In addition, I am not pulling in usernames, effectively de-identifying the dataset.\n",

    "From the exploratory analysis, it is obvious that the endometriosis posts are dominated by the word \"pain.\" However, the non-endometriosis posts have less of a gap between their first and second most common words. The words seen are those expected, as women with endometriosis suffer from debilitating pain and often have surgery. Women with PCOS, the non-endometriosis category, experience hair loss and weight gain more often. The lengths of the posts was not significantly different between categories, eliminating a potential bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations of this study included a potential selection bias, as only people with internet access who also participate in social media are included. Also it is not a requirement to be diagnosed with the condition when posting in the subreddit. Hardware also served as a limitation when tuning and training the neural network, as large graphs exhausted the memory of the compute clusters and were not able to finish training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could include using noun phrases rather than just unigrams and bigrams. A more curated dataset could be used that only includes posts with a user confirmation of diagnosis."
