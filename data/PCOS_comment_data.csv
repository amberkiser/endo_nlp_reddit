"I don't think they mean sturdy in a ""thick boned"" sense, as they specifically reference lower maternal mortality rates (hard to die in pregnancy if you're not pregnant!), higher lean muscle mass, and higher bone density. None of which implies a high BMI. There's an interesting extension of evolutionary theories to adapt to the ways in which evolution occurs and evolutionary principles shift when applied to animals that use groups and societies as an evolutionary advantage.   For example, it might be advantageous to your sibling's kids to have an auntie around who will live past 35 and who won't have any kiddos to distract her attention. It confers an advantage to your blood relatives and genes, even though they're not your direct line.   If you did get pregnant (not unlikely even with reduced fertility, if we're talking about a world with zero birth control where you married at 16 when fertility is highest) you'd have more energy to devote to your one or two kids, which is a different, and at times perhaps better, evolutionary strategy than ""have litters of kids but they all die of plague or starvation"", depending on the time frame and stresses associated.   All this to say: you might not be the evolutionary dud you feel like you are! That's my read of this article, anyway. Consider this: Joan of Arc might have had PCOS! We could  just be warrior women. :-)",/r/PCOS/comments/foto0d/an_ancient_history_of_pcos_and_possible_theories/flixyg6/,comment,2020-03-25 21:31:34-06:00

"Hi I want to say my boobs aren’t ideal as well, they only plump up when I eat a lot to being a tad bit (10lbs) overweight and if I eat low carb like most Pcos girls they deflate. The low carb helps my other symptoms but it makes me so thin and bony and it doesn’t help I can’t put on muscle due to high cortisol.

I have decided that I am going to get breast Augmentation to simply just look better in clothes and make myself happier. Plenty of women do it and are not ashamed of their procedure and in my opinion getting a breast augmentation doesn’t make you a bad person, sell out, less than, or less confident. Everyone has the right to do what they want with their bodies and it’s nobody’s right to shame them for it. I don’t advocate for anything just myself and my right to do what I please with my own body.

"I've thought about this, a lot, because I'm interested in evolutionary theory.  Fat cells produce estrogen. Excess estrogen contributes to the spiral of PCOS. Not every overweight/obese woman ends up with PCOS. But it's way more common in first-world countries. It's a disease of abundance.  When your population can barely get enough to eat, you need as many fertile women as possible (purely in terms of sustaining population; I'm obviously not saying womens' primary value is baby-making!)  When you have abundance, fewer people dying of starvation, more people having more kids, you don't need so many people having children. Having a greater portion of the population being ""sturdy"" and strong to ward off predators and competitors and to do physical work would contribute more to the survival of the population.

"Hey, I also frequent this sub in search of success stories even if they’re just small improvements because i feel it can give us girls a lot of hope(: there’s a handful of success stories on here so that’s the good news! I see a lot of people posting about how metformin and low carb diets helped them recover their lost hair as well as using spironolactone which you’re already one so that’s a plus! I also read that your scalp environment is essential for hair growth so I’m trying to use a shampoo called nizoral which has a sort of minoxidil type ingredient in it to support hair growth (: it also helps with excess oil which is so nice because my hair is an oil slick lol. I see your also taking birth control which I’ve been seeing mixed studies about but if you feel like it’s been helping you stay on it everything is about trial and error so no worries.i saw a user I believe by the name of ”strikestwice” who saw regrowth from yasmin Bcp, spironolactone, and eating low carb. She had male patterned hair loss like me. I want to tell you please don’t cry because I often used to cry but it only made me more miserable and depressed, try to stick to your regime and in the meantime do things you love to do and surround yourself with friends and family. Laughs and having a good time will distract you and give you peace of mind while you are healing :) we are all in this together and I believe we can get through this.

And the balls of loss that typically resulted from each shampoo are down to a few strands.  The Wild Growth is good for length and speeding up growth.

"For me, I could deal with it all except the hair growth. I hate it. It’s really pushed me to my emotional limit and I should probably get some therapy at this point. Since everything is closed, I can’t go for my electrolysis treatments, which are sparse anyway, and don’t seem to be helping in the long run. But that doesn’t help the rest of the body hair. I really think, for me, it’s not even worth trying to manage because I can’t. I know how you feel because sometimes I think that if I didn’t have children, there would just be no point for me to go on. I don’t want to walk around like this, for people to see me, for my children to maybe be embarrassed of me, for my husband to.   I’m not overweight, but I put on weight quickly and in weird places. I used to have breasts until my hormones really started getting bad and now I have almost none. I want to have a full life, not cutting out every single carb or food that tastes good that the rest of my family can enjoy. My body just isn’t a match with my personality. It makes me withdrawn and freak out if I feel like someone would notice.  I was pretty confident last year that I could get this under control. I know some people really focus on the positive and can get through it. Sometimes I’m that way too, but right now I’m at a low.  I completely understand how you feel. It’s hard. I wish there was an in-person support group or something in my area. It’s so, so tough.   Some things that help though? Focus on things you do well, or other areas of personal improvement. I know I can’t control a lot of these issues, but I can work out and get fit. One thing about PCOS is that I feel like I build muscle and tone up quickly when I’m consistent. A few years ago, I started watching makeup tutorials and building a routine and I think that was very helpful for a while with making me feel more feminine. When I worked at it, I would get compliments all the time. It was nice.

"I 100% feel the exact same as you about this condition. You are more than welcome to message me if you need to vent or need a friend! 1. See a therapist. This condition is traumatizing. Your feelings are valid. It's important to find acceptance and learn to cope with what we cant control. And having someone who REALLY listens and cares will make you feel better. 2. Consider antidepressant medication or mood stabilizers. (I'm bipolar, and pcos puts you at risk for it along with depression) I'm not saying you need it for the rest of your life but it would help your brain create positive pathways... help you have a more positive perspective of yourself. Medication has absolutely changed me and my life for the better. 3. Go to a dermatologist and have the body acne tested for fungal and bacterial folliculitis. My body acne is fungal folliculitis and I lived with it for over 10 years before getting treatment. Its 90% gone now and it was BAD, I'm covered in scars.

"I used to think I'd never feel sexy because I'm fat and don't have the ""right"" proportions, but others see you entirely different than you see yourself. No, I'm never going to look like a model, and of course there are still those who try to make me feel bad for it, but there have also been people who told me I was beautiful and sexy. I've realized that, while my body isn't ""perfect"", it's mine, and I've chosen to try and see it the way those sweet people do. I still have rough days, but overall I've come to appreciate my body more.

I didn’t know if I should rate how much I am affected by the symptom, or how severe the symptom actually is. For example, I have some hair loss on my head (would rate a 1), but it bothers me a great deal (3+).   - should also capture: sleep / sleep apnea. There is a huge positive correlation with PCOS and having sleep apnea, even when adjusting for weight and age. Also capture energy / exhaustion.   - capture previous medications, not just current. Maybe add a spot for reason of discontinuing meds.   - side effects of medication  - how long did it take to get diagnosed? - do you feel like your PCP cares about you and understands how to treat your diagnosis? - length of time trying to conceive?  - was birth mother diagnosed as well?",/r/PCOS/comments/fo6dfy/research_improving_medical_care_for_patients_with/flfc2w0/,comment,2020-03-24 20:20:47-06:00

"I've been having the same problem for the last two years and currently seeing a gynaecologist for it (next appt on Thursday). It is unbearable, it started off as my second day too but has now progressed to every day. People seem to think you can just take some paracetamol and ibuprofen and you should be fine, or that you just start taking painkillers at the start of your period but in reality painkillers don't even touch the pain. I've ended up in hospital with the pain twice and I have to go home sick from work every month!     My gynae doesn't think it's anything to do with PCOS but it is an overproduction of the hormone that makes the muscles contract and they don't know what causes this change. They've put me on the pill and I take 3 packets consecutively and it has helped with the pain - it's not so excruciating but still pretty bad.   Go and see a doctor because it could be a myriad of things and it's best to rule those out. Also they can help her to not suffer! Don't be like me and let it progress - also if you don't get the right support or help keep going back until she gets the help that works for her. I find anything period related when it comes to pain you don't get taken as seriously so be prepared to make a fuss if you need to! The amount of times I've heard ""take paracetamol AND ibuprofen"".

"I can’t speak to 5mg, but I’ve been taking 0.35mg of norethindrone daily as an alternative to taking a combination pill.   It’s my understanding that doctors will not prescribe Spironolactone unless you’re on some kind of birth control, due to the effect it can have on a developing fetus. (Edit: I started taking norethindrone because I wanted to avoid the combination pill, but also wanted to start taking Spironolactone).   Norethindrone is a progesterone only birth control pill (it does not contain estrogen) so it carries less risk for clots than the combination pill (which contains progesterone and estrogen) does. As a birth control method though, it is less effective than the combination pill, so that’s something to keep in mind.

"I did the survey, but there are a few things missing.   – question about co-morbidities. Hashimoto is a common illness to turn up with PCOS, but it also means you don't exactly know where hormonal issues come from if someone has it. It would be helpful to know if someone has got hormonal double-trouble or not.  – there were a ton of questions (I assume some for cross-verification) about fertility and struggles to become pregnant. That completely ignores women who may not have been in a situation yet to even try for children. If the only option is to then grade it as ""no problem"" or similar, it looks like it's all a-ok, and not like something a woman worries about without having had opportunity to even give it a try  – the question about medication: you need to ask for how long someone has been taking it, probably best after the question of when someone was diagnosed. My PCOS went untreated for 25 years, and only in the last year have I found a doctor who a)treats it at all and b) doesn't just throw the pill at it, but actually treats the underlying cause of insulin resistance.  I'm also not sure if the 1-4 grading system that goes up to ""all the time"" is the right format, as the intensity of suffering isn't best measured by asking how *often* someone feels like this, but by asking how much of an impact someone feels it has. Those aren't the same. But I'm not sure if that can be changed at this point.",/r/PCOS/comments/fo6dfy/research_improving_medical_care_for_patients_with/flehw3d/,comment,2020-03-24 15:18:28-06:00

"Hey, so here's a quick run down of the very important basics I learned from my experience taking a moderate dose for 5 months:   * Don't drink on the medication...It's better to be safe than sorry! Your liver is more vulnerable and you can easily develop stomach problems from mixing the two.  * Take it with a small amount of fat to improve absorption, but if you're sensitive don't go overboard on the fat intake.  * Be aware that Accutane can weaken your immunity. I caught Mono the month after I stopped taking it. However, I wasn't taking care of my health at the time (thyroid issues, low vitamin D/Zinc/B12 levels).   Accutane cleared my skin up in a way that gave me my life back. I've been cystic acne-free for over 3 years.

As a healthcare professional, it is important to limit that sort of language as it can be frustrating for LGTBQ+ individuals AND it is also lacking information. For example, saying “male pattern hair growth” doesn’t really tell the patient where exactly they may grow excess hair. What exactly fits into the male pattern? What about the not so obvious areas covered by clothing? It’s unclear and assumes the patient can fill in the gaps, when maybe they can’t.

Some bleeding combined with my symptoms improving greatly and everything else on top of that, Its an amazing feeling, Regardless the fact that it's withdrawal bleeding, Personally PCOS makes me feel like I've been stripped of all my femininity, So just the slight things to make me feel normal again whether or not its just my birth control causing a simulation of a light cycle, It mentally/emotionally lifts my spirits! I'm not my PCOS and when PCOS causes the exact opposite of the traditional beauty standards its heart breaking, But finally seeing changes after over 4 years of nothing, I've never felt more positive and genuinely happy in so long! :)",/r/PCOS/comments/fnxzp6/so_girls_i_think_ive_just_gotten_my_period/fldiqi6/,comment,2020-03-24 09:55:44-06:00

"A lot of science is not open access so I'm sorry you couldn't find the literature you were looking for. And typically you are correct in that a lot of historical research has been male-centric. However we do know a lot about a lot of biological systems.   There is no perfect experiment. Everything we know about the world is a model that we believe based on all the evidence we have. In this scenario proving a model is near impossible, so most of science relies on disproving old ideas to get a more nuanced picture of reality. Take this in the kindest possible way - biological systems are extremely complex. No one can say they 'fully understand' x or y. Even digesting the current literature we have on a niche topic is a gargantuan task that requires literal years.",/r/PCOS/comments/fntny5/sexual_dimorphism_and_immunity_estrogen_immune/fld5wse/,comment,2020-03-24 07:42:31-06:00

"That is very true. All this is very complex. Also, I started looking into testosterone lowering immune response and finding that only 2 out of many immune responses were effected. When I started looking deeper it became apparent that these experiments are very flawed, unnatural, and have too many factors that are easily changed.   With all that said. I question almost everything I read about woman's health. For too long men had the driving power to push medicine forward and when it came to woman's health, they perceived everything from a man's perspective. Only now is there interest in acknowledging that woman and their hormones play a huge role on how they respond to treatment, viruses, diseases...

"The beginning of the review linked in the post has some good references and statistics on the male female difference. You should absolutely draw your own conclusions from the primary literature 😊  About the PCOS difference, when they talk about the effect of estrogen, it is relative to testosterone (and not relative to progesterone as I assume OP meant by estrogen dominance). Higher E/T tilts the immune system to be more aggressive amd slightly less specific about self/non-self while a lower E/T ratio favors a more tolerant immune system that is anti-inflammatory. Both scenarios have their pros and cons.   For women with PCOS, it's difficult to say what would happen because other hormones like cortisol also make a huge difference, but going by pure E/T ratio, I would predict the higher T would decrease immune reactivity relative to non-PCOS women (note, we don't know how high T needs to be for this to happen ). Hormones are very complicated and interconnected so its pretty hard to extrapolate without direct evidence.",/r/PCOS/comments/fntny5/sexual_dimorphism_and_immunity_estrogen_immune/fld2e6f/,comment,2020-03-24 06:58:39-06:00

Might be time for a new doctor...  Could be because you don't have anymore distractions so you can now focus on it or could be positioning. Pelvic muscles coukd also be more relaxed so you feel the spasms /contractions more.   You could try sleeping in your back with legs elevated (like pillows under your calves so it's like you are in the same position as sitting in a chair but laying down).

On the one hand you have immunocompromised populations where the virus takes over and destroys the organs completely.

The immune system ends up attacking self and non-self cells indiscriminately which also leads to organ failure.

"Tldr: I personally recommend Nuvaring even though it has some cons.  Sorry if this is way more info than you wanted, but I have experience so I thought I’d be thorough. 😊 I used Nuvaring for 4.5 years. Loved it the whole time. I’m personally not a big proponent of hormonal birth control now that I’ve learned a lot after coming off of it, but if you’re going to go with HBC then I for sure recommend it. Here are my personal pros and cons. Also, just asked my partner and he said it was his favorite birth control experience as well.  Cons:  - It took me a bit to figure out how to get it to sit properly. - The doc told me she’d give me $200 if my partner was ever bothered by it or accidentally pulled it out during sex. She owes me $200 multiple times over. - I could feel it during sex sometimes. - I chose to go the 3 weeks in 1 week out route and sometimes I’d end up putting it in when I wasn’t done with my period. That wouldn’t have been a problem except sometimes using tampons at the same time as having it in was uncomfortable and I had to make sure not to pull it out along with the tampon.  - One time in the 4.5 years of me using it, it fell out and I didn’t notice. I ended up with an early period and was very confused until I figured out it wasn’t where it was supposed to be. After that I checked it more often especially after sex. - Low sex drive the whole time. Didn’t bother me too much until I came off it and figured out what I was missing.  - At the tail end of the 4.5 years I started getting some annoying symptoms that I link to hormonal birth control. Constant headaches and nausea. High blood pressure. Fatigue.  Pros: - Very easy to use. Just shove it up there and forget about it. I used an app that notified me when to take it out and put it back in. Definitely enjoyed not having to take a pill everyday at the same time. I would have failed at oral contraceptives.  - Once I figured out how to place it right I never noticed or felt it. - If it does bug you or your partner during sex it is safe to take it out for a few minutes while you’re enjoying yourself and then rinse it off and put it back. I usually only did this in certain positions that made it more uncomfortable. (Again sorry if it’s tmi, but figured I’d be thorough) - You can mimic a cycle with the in for 3 out for 1 method. It shortened my periods, but didn’t affect flow or cramps. I had a pretty easy cycle so it stayed the same for me just shorter.",/r/PCOS/comments/fneopq/nuvaring_experiences/flc30lq/,comment,2020-03-23 20:57:01-06:00

I think metformin would definitely help your hair regrow because it’s actually attacking  the cause of the hormonal imbalance in the first place which is insulin resistance. Metformin helps to lower insulin/regulate insulin which in turn will lower your testosterone pumping out from your ovaries. I am eating low carb to help IR and my hair and face is less greasy(also caused by high testosterone). Washing your hair less or putting it up doesn’t stop an internal hormonal issue and it will continue to fall out. I know it seems like doing these things will help but they sadly won’t. I think spironolactone is also great for lowering high testosterone so that’s a good route people can choose. I also suffer from this and it can be extremely nerving and depressing but hopefully by following these guidelines we can all recover from this stupid illness.,/r/PCOS/comments/fnk7hn/metformin_q_if_it_works_for_one_symptom_of_pcos/flb6l01/,comment,2020-03-23 15:20:24-06:00

"Actually, depending on your hormones there is a possibility it could put you at slightly more risk OR slightly less risk. Statistics are showing that even after you exclude the smoking factor (more men than women smoke), the risk of worse symptoms or death is still higher in men. Studies of previous coronavirus (SARS and MERS) indicate that this could be due to women having higher estrogen levels. So if your PCOS presents with low estrogen, you could be at more risk. If it presents with more estrogen, you could be at less risk. But this is all still preliminary research with no other studies done that I could find, and so not definitive.

"Commenting again to add what’s been working for me.   I typically tweeze and then the next time I remove hair I shave. I find shaving gets more of the hair and leaves a smoother surface, while tweezing doesn’t leave the dark stubble/ shadow.  I’ve recently started taking spironolactone and I can’t explain how happy it’s made me. It’s been almost a month and I’ve already noticed a reduction in the amount of terminal hairs and speed of regrowth! (I know it takes 3-6 months to see real benefits from it, but it’s been nice to be optimistic).   If your hair growth is hormonal (as most of ours is) the best way to treat it is by trying to correct the hormonal imbalance, and that is going to look different from one PCOS case to another! 😘",/r/PCOS/comments/fne3py/chinneck_hair_growth/flaq0sx/,comment,2020-03-23 12:40:13-06:00

"Yaz has 0.02mg of estrogen vs Yasmin with 0.03mg of the same type of estrogen and a different number of placebo pills. They are the same medication otherwise.  For example, if you have spotting in between periods on Yaz you can try Yasmin instead. Starting with the lower dose is generally recommended.  I personally believe both of these pills are exceptionally good for pcos because of the effect drospirenone has on some of the typical symptoms like increased testosterone and hair growth. But even still, women react differently to different birth control pills and it sometimes take two or more changes to figure out which one helps the most.",/r/PCOS/comments/fnj0b8/is_yasmin_birth_control_a_safe_medicine_for_pcod/flanhgx/,comment,2020-03-23 12:16:03-06:00

"Actually, depending on your hormones there is a possibility it could put you at slightly more risk OR slightly less risk.  Statistics are showing that even after you exclude the smoking factor (more men than women smoke), the risk of worse symptoms or death is still higher in men.  Studies of previous coronavirus (SARS and MERS) indicate that this could be due to women having higher estrogen levels.  So if your PCOS presents with low estrogen, you could be at more risk.  If it presents with more estrogen, you could be at less risk.  But this is all still preliminary research with no other studies done that I could find, and so not definitive.

"[HIRSUTISM: EVALUATION AND TREATMENT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2856356/)   I highly encourage everyone to read this study.  “Treatment  Most women resort to removal of hair by different epilation methods, such as plucking, shaving, and waxing before presenting to the clinic. Though simple and inexpensive, these methods are temporary and have their own side effects like physical discomfort, scarring, folliculitis, irritant dermatitis or discoloration. Electrolysis has also been used for the removal of the hair. With repeated treatments, the efficacy ranges from 15 to 50% permanent hair loss.[14] However, it is difficult to treat large areas like hairs on the chest or upper back with electrolysis and it can be time consuming.  Lasers have gained wide popularity in past two decades and can achieve permanent reduction of hair (not removal). They work on the principle of selective photothermolysis where the laser energy acts specifically to destroy the target (melanin).[15,16] Laser energy acts on only anagen hair follicles. Therefore, multiple treatment is required to get a significant (i.e. 80%) reduction. An ideal candidate for laser hair removal is a patient with light skin color and dark colored hairs. Different lasers for hair removal include 694-nm ruby laser, the 1064-nm Q-switched Nd: YAG laser, the 755 nm long-pulsed alexandrite, and the 800-nm diode laser. For Indian skin types (Type IV and V), long wavelength lasers like the Nd Yag laser have been found to be most effective.[17]   Laser hair removal is most suitable for idiopathic hirsutism with the normal androgen levels.”",/r/PCOS/comments/fne3py/chinneck_hair_growth/fl9v6kn/,comment,2020-03-23 07:28:57-06:00

"I don't think antiobiotics ""cancel out"" your hormonal BC. I think it used to be the case or could be the case with some specific kinds, but as a general rule antibiotics won't mean that your BC no longer works (but definitely still use secondary protection while taking them and for a week after). Similarly, I don't think an infection probably would do that either but all that said, I'm not a doctor. I think you should just call your doctor and ask.

"I feel you! I understand your problem and go through the same thing! As far as the shaving I have found that Aveeno shaving cream does not give me skin a reaction. I think it's because it does not contain smells and additives. I also use Nivea aftershave balm, I actually use it as face lotion. It's perfect for my skin because it isn't oily and dries fast. Yes, it has a manly smell to it but by the time I get to work the smell is gone. It's crappy that we need to do this, but I have been doing it so long that I have come to terms with it. It's just who I am and how my body was born. I realize this is easier said than done but once we accept something that cannot be changed, I think it changes our outlook on life.

"That actually happened to me the first time I visited there and it was such a nightmare to straighten out. The worst part was the uncovered bloodwork. After a lot of phone calls back and forth with billing and my insurance, I decided to go back in for a yearly exam a few months after the consultation visit and discussed this with the doctor herself. She was just as livid as me that it wasn’t covered and demanded the billing department change the codes and resubmit to my insurance. She even made a note in my chart to not use those other codes anymore. Everything worked out in the end and she is so great that I was able to look past that. Looking back I should’ve called my insurance company to see if they cover PCOS. I have BlueCross and they see PCOS as an “infertility and sexual dysfunction diagnosis” code so although the practice is within network that code is not covered.

Hmm well it could be any of these things:   1. You might have an underlying medical condition that can make it hard to gain weight   2. You are not eating enough calories for your height/lifestyle.   3. You might be eating enough but you are over exercising that you end up with calorie deficit.

"NuvaRing was my favorite BC before I got my IUD. Evened out my periods, lessened cramps - it was great! It’s an even flow of hormones, unlike the ups and downs of pills as your body processes them. I will say you need to be **very** comfortable with your own body to use it - you don’t get an applicator like with a tampon, so you have to use your fingers to put it in and take it out. It didn’t bother me, but that’s a dealbreaker for some people. I had a partner with a penis at the time, and he never had any complaints about feeling it during sexy times, so that’s a bonus. I also never had it fall out, but some people have that issue - I think that’s more of your personal anatomy than a product flaw, though.  The biggest drawback is that it’s expensive. I eventually gave it up for the pill because the pills were free under my insurance (some generic brand), while NuvaRing was close to $90 a month at the time. See what your insurance will offer you, but if you can afford it, I definitely recommend it.",/r/PCOS/comments/fneopq/nuvaring_experiences/fl99r22/,comment,2020-03-23 00:50:01-06:00
"Hi, you helped me on my Wordpress post so I'd like to help you here. I'm not from the UK, but coincidentally I watched Sue Hulk's youtube video ""Trying For A Baby My IVF Journey #1"" the other day where she details how she struggled with IVF through NHS and chose the private route instead. Note: she doesn't have PCOS but she has a thyroid condition/infertility. She also mentioned how she didn't think enough people were talking about this circumstance, so hopefully if you watch the video it might make you feel a bit better.   Secondly, and I'm not trying to assume anything right now, but it might help to talk to your doctor. Have you ever had your periods? Maybe that could be your first step. Or maybe you could get your egg count evaluated. Without seeming counterproductive, I've heard that birth control actually helps women with PCOS lose weight, if you want that to be the first step. I'm sure your doctor would have some recommendations. Best of luck and wishing you goodness and baby magic &lt;3",/r/PCOS/comments/figx6x/pregnancy_success_stories_in_the_uk/fl99ek1/,comment,2020-03-23 00:43:28-06:00

I know that this sub is not a huge fan when it comes to more natural options but you could try Peony and Licorice combination. It’s supposed to elevate your estrogen while simultaneously decrease your testosterone. Please keep in mind that natural options can take up to 3 months in order to see results.   I’m just a little cautious when it comes to birth control because in the end it’s only a temporary solution (unless you want to take it for life) and doesn’t get to the root of the problem.

I also went vegetarian a few months ago, I was only diagnosed early last year, and I have found this works for me, I've lost about 14kg over 4 or 5 months. It's really just finding the balance that works for you and your body. Dont loose hope, keep trying different things and give the new things time to really take affect, I'm sure you will find something that helps.  Edit: I forgot exercise of course, I tend to be super fatigued with the meds and pcos in general but I try to always hit my step goal or beat it every day, just that little thing helps heaps",/r/PCOS/comments/fms91f/weightloss_not_happening_with_metformin/fl8h5op/,comment,2020-03-22 18:32:55-06:00

"Hmm, I may have had something similar when my PCOS symptoms were at their worst. Kept trying to convince myself my bf must be cheating on me, even though there was no evidence of this. But every night out, working late etc was cause for suspicion. That was not a fun time. It got better when I started working on fixing up my PCOS issues and I also saw a therapist for a few months which helped me with underlying trust issues etc from my past. I am in a much better place with myself and my relationship now. It might be worth going to a therapist now because it's possible that PCOS is exacerbating underlying issues rather than causing a whole new issue, also it can help you cope with things while you get your hormones straightened out.",/r/PCOS/comments/fn84x8/does_anyone_experience_symptoms_of_ppd/fl8gy0e/,comment,2020-03-22 18:30:35-06:00

If you eat primarily meat you'll get sick due to eating too much meat.  You see the point? When you're eating very little it doesn't matter what you eat. Later on it's an entirely different story.

Spiro apparently can make your cycle a bit weird. When I was on it I would often get a few days of super light bleeding here and there (more like spotting really). I wasn't really tracking at the time but I think it was generally 2-4 weeks apart. I did mention it to my doctor and they said it was periods although I wasn't convinced. Wnen I switched to metformin my periods became much more like what I consider a period with acutal flow etc. Definitely check with your doctor if you're concerned though.,/r/PCOS/comments/fn49mt/spironolactone_and_weird_periods/fl7z3ii/,comment,2020-03-22 15:27:37-06:00

Your womb is more than likely perfect. Most women with PCOS have hormonal imbalances and have high miscarriage rate (like low progesterone). If you’re having regular periods though that’s an excellent start as you’re probably ovulating regularly but may need a progesterone boost to get a healthy plumper egg to stick. Also make sure you’re getting your TSH tested for healthy ranges too because that can also cause miscarriage. Making sure you see a specialist that knows about PCOS and pregnancy can make all the difference in these situations.   I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I had over 13 miscarriages and 1 ectopic. I did have 3 live births though as well.

"I'm 5' 2"" and 89lbs!!! I thought I was alone! Lol It's nearly impossible for me to gain weight, even with a food scale and a log. And I've also been losing hair.    So, this might not help you, because it's so rare outside of the Jewish population, but they're pretty sure I actually have Non- Classical Adrenal Hyperplasia. It seriously mimics PCOS, but people are generally short and have a very very hard time maintaining a healthy BMI.    People think you're making it up because most gain weight very easily. But it's nearly impossible and it's only gotten worse since I've been older. I genuinely have to maintain a diet of over 2700 calories to keep myself above the 18.5 BMI mark, which (according to the New BMI) only starts at 97.5.    I'm not sure if this is helpful or not. But I wanted to reach out because I was pretty scared for a long time that something else was seriously wrong with me. If you can, bring this up with a health care provider or an endocrinologist to get tested. I eat a diet for insulin resistance for now. But I'm supposed to start therapy with very low doses of corticosteroids soon.    Oh, also, restlessness and insomnia are also symptoms.

"My SO has PCOS and other health issues. Back in high school before we met, she used to be athletic- think floor gymnastics and weightlifting, not soccer/track. It took me forever to notice she liked me and even longer for me to realize I like her. She's fat, probably bordering on obese. Saying I dont care would be a lie, I do care...but only because I know things like being overweight isnt good for her health and causes her other health issues to be that much harder. If she was 5'2 120 and fit, I'd feel pretty much the same way I do now. We share a lot of common interests, being around her makes my anxiety go away.   Should have figured out I liked her years earlier when we went to a concert in Texas together. Flying home the airline upgraded my seat to first class due having a frequent flyer account since I was a wee baby. I gave up a free upgrade to first class to sit with my friend for 3 hours on a flight home.  I'm disabled.  I'm completely uncoordinated, I walk with a limp and wobble like an adorable penguin. I have a medical implant in my brain and I think my DNA got mixed up with some dog... I'm super hairy, and its dark and a little curly which makes it even more apparent. For reasons I cannot fathom even years later- she finds me attractive and sometimes thinks about me naked.   I said something about being hairy myself once and she responded with: It's not a big deal, you're Italian by heritage, it's expected. Besides, if it bothers me I can always just shave you in your sleep   O_O   Um.... you dont have to do that. If it bothers you - I'd figure out how to deal with it, although I might need some help.

"To have PCOS you need to have two outta three; cysts on the ovaries (I think the number has gone down to 15 or something now, but you need far more than three. Cysts is almost a misnomer as they're actually just underdeveloped and immature eggs that decide not to participate in ovulation so they become 'cysts'), blood work done (high levels of androgens, testosterone, DHEAs, and so forth) and then physical attributes (irregular/missing periods, excess male pattern hair growth, acne, overweight or difficulty losing weight, etc.)  Your cysts don't need to 'grow' to have PCOS, you need more of them.

Fat from nuts is also harder to digest, so some calories can't be used anyway, similar to calories from fiber. So OP, if you're vegan, definitely don't drop nuts and seeds completely, esp. chia and flax seeds are super important for omega 3 fatty acids.

"Hey there, I'm in the same boat. Sometimes I bleed and cramp heavily for months on end! Here's two things I do to get me through, that are life-changing :  1) TAKE IRON SUPPLIMENTS! seriously, I'll be in a horrible moodswing, take one, and 30 mins later feel happy like myself again. I also try to take chromium when I can afford it!  2) GET A MENSTRAL CUP! Yes, it takes a month to figure it out. You'll have leaking and hate it for a while, because it takes some time to figure out exactly how you're shaped, exactly how to fold it to insert when you change. It sucks having an upfront cost, mine was $70NZD. Wear a pad while you figure it out, and then you'll be home free. I've had my mental cup for nearly 7 years now! I've NEVER had to buy pads or tampons since! I have a heavy flow, and empty it in the shower when I wake up, and at night before bed.   It's changed my life. I don't feel it, think about it, smell it, worry about it at work or travel. Times I'm bleeding for 3+ months, it saves a lot of money and waste! And now with the whole pandemic shit, the shelves are empty for feminine products, and I'm just so happy to be using it.   And lastly, I've been checked out, I know my bleeding for months is teiggered from stress and my PCOS, it's happened to me since 14.. nothing crazy is going on down there. But you can't be sure, so have a gyno check you just to be sure!!  Hope this helps!",/r/PCOS/comments/fmum2p/unable_to_stop_period/fl6ajwm/,comment,2020-03-22 01:00:06-06:00

I would see your doctor/Obgyn. I have PCOS and I do not have facial hair and have pretty moderate acne. You don’t have to have all the symptoms to have PCOS. My periods are very irregular sometimes a month late sometimes 3 months. But you won’t know for sure until you visit your doctor.  There are also other ways if you don’t want to be on birth control. I can’t take birth control because of other personal reasons. Your doctor can work with you on lifestyle and diet changes but most do recommend birth control because it regulates your period.

"You  need two out of three criteria to have PCOS 1) Cysts on ovaries 2) Higher androgen  levels (hirsutism, hair fall, acne, more belly fat etc.) 3) Irregular periods.   So, you can have PCOS even without cysts (I do and as do many other women). Also, PCOS never truly disappears (it's genetic, can't delete genes). It can be managed though, and it sounds like you were managing it! You need to ask yourself: what did you do prior to your symptoms disappearing? Maybe those things were effective and you need to replicate those actions again. What symptoms did you have before they disappeared? Did your food intake change, maybe due to all this corona stress?   As for what you should do, don't hate me, but relax. PCOS sucks sure, but stressing about it isn't going to help. Even if you do have PCOS you can seek out treatment later when things calm down a bit. For now, things you can do to manage your symptoms are:  1) Relaxing (stress is not good for anything)  2) Cutting down or completely eliminating sugar and processed food + lowering your carb intake (this unfortunately includes potatoes, bread and other wheat products)  Instead fill up on vegetables, legumes, meat, fish, egg, nuts etc.  3)  At home stretching or even light exercise",/r/PCOS/comments/fmax4u/do_i_have_pcos/fl4c1z0/,comment,2020-03-21 11:06:06-06:00

I'm treating my PCOS now by seeing both my OB and a nutritionist with a focus on weight loss and gut health. I'm under a strict diet now. Maybe you want to try seeing a nutritionist to focus on hormonal balance? I feel that the less than feminine proportions might have something to do with androgen levels? Try out fenugreek?

"Hey fellow Cyster, sorry you had to deal with that that's not a great situation and fighting with your S/O is never fun :/ First things first having blood sugar issues and insulin resistance issues (drastic highs and lows) can all be fixed relatively easily by doing the recommended PCOS diet of low carbohydrate no sugars (No dairy or Gluten  as well for some). When you eat sugar and have high insulin levels you then have drastic drops like you experienced. You shouldn't have to eat every few hours or ride the blood sugar waves that often will dictate how you feel (Personal experience they really do control my mood). This will help with the spike and drops, mood as well as weightloss.

"I have a ""growth"" in my pituitary gland that produces Prolactin. This is called Prolactinoma, you can get great info on it on various reputable sites on the web.  If this is indeed what you have it is in most cases nothing to be worried about. In almost all cases there is very good treatment available and these types of tumors are not malignant as far as I know.  I have been on a drug called Dostinex (Cabergoline) for 10 years and it works very well. I take a small pill two times a week and my tumor is almost non existant at this point and my Prolactin is normal.  Tumor sounds very serious and if nothing is done this can wreak havoc on your body but it is not fatal, and in my case barely an inconvenience.   It was a little tough before diagnosis because my periods stopped, I had breastmilk though I had never been pregnant and I had some weight gain. I also had mild headaches but all this disappeared after a few months on Dostinex.  I was pretty lucky because some people have to have surgery to remove these types of tumors but even that is a pretty common operation according to my doctor.  Just remember that there are various possible reasons for your elevated Prolactin and most of them are not terrible although they might be difficult.

"This is a really hard question to answer.  Even medical professionals can't really say with any certainty, other than that they know that as weight goes up, comorbidities go up.   I think one thing to ask yourself is honestly: are you staying at about your same weight?  Or are you increasing in weight? Increases in weight indicate that your insulin resistance is getting worse, and that would definitely indicate that you should turn it around and cut back on the carbs.  As you are only 21 you only have a few years of post-growing so it's hard to tell at this point if your weight has stabilized or not.  Losing weight rapidly or in crash diets that don't work for you for the long term is almost never a good idea unless you are considerably overweight.  Whatever you do with your diet needs to be something you can sustain long-term, or when you stop restricting you will gain it all back.  If you are comfortable with your portions and don't seem to be gaining weight, then I would stick with what you have.  Be advised if you are over BMI 35 elective surgery and things like IVF become more difficult to acquire based on clinic limits so there are lines you will always want to be under.  Basically: get a scale and monitor the situation.  Keep an eye on it especially during stressful times (or very exciting times) as those are when you're likely to ""magically"" gain 30 pounds in a month.  Don't let that happen to you.",/r/PCOS/comments/fm4qin/do_i_have_to_always_be_actively_losing_weight/fl2drfz/,comment,2020-03-20 17:58:13-06:00

"Usually those who gain weight in IF (or in general really) are consuming more calories than they burn. CICO is the only way to lose weight. It doesn't matter if you're doing paleo, vegan, keto whatever. Even with PCOS or IF, CICO is number one. Now, with PCOS we often have insulin resistance, that's where IF comes in. IF allows your body to clear it's insulin for some time which allows your body to utilize it's fat if you're in a caloric deficit. So, you could give IF a try. But first, calculate your maintenance calories.  You can use online calculators, but they're not the most accurate. One thing instead you could do is: weigh yourself and jot the weight down. Then, everyday for a week weigh or measure your food (everything, even oil) and input it into myfitnesspal, lose it whatever online calorie calculator. Then by the end of the week add all of the calories you've consumed the past 7 days and divide by seven to get an average calorie consumed. Weigh yourself after that week. If you've maintained weight, then those calories are your maintenance. Then, simply subtract 300-500 calories from that maintenance calories per day. That will result in .5-1lbs/week of losing  Edit: another thing I'd suggest is doing all of this slowly. Cutting down on processed food and added sugar as to begin with will already cut majority of calories and carbs",/r/PCOS/comments/flz09u/how_to_properly_lose_weight_with_pcos/fl1m1d4/,comment,2020-03-20 13:14:31-06:00

"First of all, thank you for continuing to work in this time of crisis.  Also, maybe right now is not the ideal time to be worrying about weight loss while working long shifts and exposing yourself to Covid-19.  Unless you are already in the over 40 BMI that makes you high risk to start with, eating at a deficit could put you at more risk.  So if you are going to do this now, make sure to keep the deficit small.  That being said, I think the most important thing is to cut sugars.  Sugary food and drink is the most obvious first step, followed by heavily processed foods.  It isn't necessary to cut healthy carbs, such as fruits and veggies.  I've lost 100 pounds and eat potatoes at least 4 times a week.  I definitely went lower carb than I previously was, but I was nowhere near keto level.  The biggest thing is focusing on unprocessed foods.",/r/PCOS/comments/flszak/whats_the_best_diet_for_someone_whos_got_pcos/fl15oeq/,comment,2020-03-20 10:41:32-06:00

"It helps to find a motive on why you’re doing all of this in the first place.   Is it to reduce symptoms such as acne, hair loss, and having unpredictable periods?   Perhaps you may want children some day or you want to take care of your health to prevent diseases such as type 2 diabetes or ovarian cancer?   Whatever your reason may be it helps to have a motive!

"Both, actually! It takes a minimum of 15 days for you to barely see any results. However, depending on the severity of the AN (how patchy or dark is), it might take longer (maybe a 1-2 months). The only drawback is that it’s a topical treatment: the moment you stop using hydroquinone, the AN will come back *snifs*. I’ve been using it for 5+ years before/during summer and I rest on winter time. I’ve seen a slight decrease of AN over the years, but I’ve been in hormonal treatment for PCOS and diet change so I can’t attribute it only to hydroquinone.

this is so comforting. thank you so much for calming me down a little. I really wish I was invisible at the gym. I think that people should only approach somebody if they are making potentially dangerous mistakes. Even though I know they have good intentions it just leaves me sad. I also wish metformin worked for me. I just have such a sensitive stomach that even my mini pill upsets it sometimes. I think I may try the metformin again once I’m fully adjusted to my new pill. It was hard to tell which medication was causing the stomach upset but something tells me it was both of them. I’ve been wanting to contact my gyno about supplements like inositol or DIM but our insurance is so bad and my parents don’t know if they can afford another appointment other than just the routine 1 visit per year that is covered.

"It gets me boiling mad when men approach me in the gym. Doesn’t matter if they think they’re helping or not- gym is me time and I’d rather you not mansplain weight machines to me.   I’m so sorry you’re having a hard time. When I was a younger adult (your age, about 15 years ago) I found it impossible to lose weight even though I was very active- a camp counselor, hiking, rock climbing, hot yoga, rode a bike to school, performed in musical theatre (dancing) and cooked all my meals at home, what I thought were healthy meals. I got up to 300 lbs during that time. I eventually lost 120 lbs, just counting calories, making sure I ate a variety of different foods, and exercising. I used the myfitnesspal app to track all of it. That and metformin and I lost the weight. After I lost my insurance I had to stop metformin for several years and even though I’ve maintained my diet and activity level, I’ve gotten way less strict about counting calories, but also started running marathons so I figured I was allowed lol. Anyway, regardless of how healthy I was living, being off metformin for years I gained about 18 lbs back. Since starting metformin again (thanks medicaid!) I’m down about 5 and almost back to where I was before (still about 20 lbs away from my goal- so I’m about 30 lbs away from whatever I decided my ideal weight was).   I will say this though- all this social isolation and just the entire world changing due to covid- I’m starting to prioritize different aspects of my health other than weight. It’s a weird time, man.   I guess all I’m saying is- it’s possible, and as annoying as the advice “you have to find what works for you” is- it’s the best advice. Keto didn’t work for me- I lost a lot of weight and then gained it all back and my blood pressure went way up in the process. But calories in/calories out + a varied and frequent exercise routine did work for a HUGE portion of my weight. The rest is just figuring out how to be happy in the skin you’re in and being kind to yourself in the process.   There’s one person who has been with you since the moment you were born and will be with you until the moment you die- that person is you. And you should be kind to yourself, and take care of yourself.",/r/PCOS/comments/flvb1e/im_so_sick_of_feeling_so_fat/fl0tqf1/,comment,2020-03-20 08:45:38-06:00

Low carb doesn’t have to equal no energy. If you are hitting your macros with protein it should help with energy.

"My eyebrows are thick and beautiful and I don't even have to do anything to them. Yes body/facial hair grows thicker and faster, but so does the hair on my head. Natural red head with thick hair to my waist. Yes I have signs of a slightly receding hairline but it's not too noticeable if I switch my parting around.

"So I was ttc for two years before getting pregnant the first time. I was on letrozole, Clomid, a combo of the two, and hcg and progesterone injections post ovulation for about a year. I happened to get pregnant on an off medication (still did post peak injections) cycle on CD18.   Then, 5 months postpartum, I was ecstatic to find out we had gotten pregnant naturally (while EBing) without even really ttc, just not preventing. Unfortunately, that ended in a miscarriage at 8 weeks, but then I really thought that I could get pregnant on my own since I had twice now.   Well, it's now 1 1/2 years later and still no luck. After a 103 day cycle in the fall I finally gave up with ttc without medication and am back on Clomid (gotta love those hot flashes!)  I think it's different for everyone. I've experienced both ways at this point. I know that my thyroid went out of control after giving birth because I had to stop taking one of my medications and I'm sure that's a big factor in my issues. If you are feeling so much better, it probably is an indication that your hormones are better balanced. PCOS affects us all so differently that it's hard to tell what will happen based on other's experiences.

"Well I got pregnant on my own (after 15 months) for my 1st pregnancy. This time for #2, I'm on letrozole. We've been trying for over 6 months. I do get my periods on my own. I even had two cycles that were 28 days a couple months ago. Typically, my cycles go anywhere from 35-40 days. I got pregnant sometime between calendar day 23-26 last time, so I know I can ovulate on my own during those longer cycles. Its possible to get pregnant on your own, it just might take longer. I don't feel like I got a ""reset"" after pregnancy, but I have heard that for a couple months after pregnancy, your hormones are more balanced out. Its worth a shot to at least give it a go for 6 months or so on your own to see what happens.   I had a friend who never tried to get pregnant on her own (due to pcos). I thought it strange they allowed her meds without her even trying, but I think she was adamant about what she wanted. Anyway, she got pregnant one cycle on clomid (turns out she got pregnant before clomid wouldve made her ovulate). Pregnancy #2, she again demands clomid. Has a miscarriage super early. I dont think the baby ever was formed right bc she was having pregnancy symptoms,  but couldnt get a positive (she demanded a urine test, blood test, and ultrasound at the doctor) until weeks after her symptoms. At that point, the doctor basically told her not to come back until she tried on her own and to stop with all the demands. She tried one month and was immediately pregnant. So some people jump the gun like her to fertility meds when they never needed them in the first place.

"I totally understand the extra hair/temper tantrums/fatigue/fogginess/depression/anxiety/anything else that goes with it, etc! B vitamins are my friend, but also, having a protein-filled meal in the morning (even when I don't want it!) really sets me up well emotionally for the rest of the day! Magnesium is great before sleep, to make sure you are rested and not adding to being tired in the morning!  I am so lucky that I don't have acne/hair loss - but I put this down to being medicated for most of my pubescent life. Have you tried birth control, certain birth control pills that have extra hormones to help consolidate with those you may be missing?   I also have keratosis-pilaris, and as a result have been religiously using a salycilic acid face-scrub every day since I was pre-pubescent ( I am used to it, may be too harsh everyday for you, maybe try every second or third day?). This may help with bumps! My go-to is the St Ives black-head removing scrub, gentle but effective! But deep cleansing also needs to be matched with moisturising, otherwise there can become a build-up of dried old dead skin cells, which clog things further! If you have scars, dermarolling can also work, if you space out treatments effectively to give skin time to heal (4-6 weeks). Can also use (instead of scrub) a salycilic acid moisturiser, but it CANNOT come in contact with the sun, else it burns (sensitive!)!

"Personally, if I pluck any leg hair, the bulb is black (growing phase) not white. Each hair was jet black (even though I'm a blonde). My hair was a struggle, until I finished uni and got a job, then got laser hair removal. Literally every single hair fell out after 3 weeks.

"PCOS positives:   * Women with PCOS are more likely than average to be lesbian or bisexual, which is great because it means you don't have to date men. * Higher libido. * Slower metabolism means you save money on food and can survive longer if the food supply chain breaks down. * More hair means you stay slightly warmer in the winter.   * Easier to build muscle. * Less frequent periods. * Less likely to get accidentally pregnant. * Anxiety and depression from PCOS gives you instant cred as a tortured artist/writer.   * Have more empathy for others dealing with chronic health conditions. * Instant sisterhood and solidarity with other PCOS ladies. * Won't be involuntarily drafted into the SpaceForce because of increased intercranial pressure which can cause blindless from long term exposure to zero gravity environments. * Stylish mustache.   * Can braid leg hair into crude leggings if you run out of pants and need to attend a formal event that requires leggings.  edit: I made it into a [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/trollPCOS/comments/flnt0p/look_on_the_bright_side/).",/r/PCOS/comments/flj2el/what_makes_pcos_worth_the_struggle_for_you/fkzjc6k/,comment,2020-03-19 20:46:06-06:00

For you, that's 9 years away. You have enough time to decide FOR YOURSELF as well whether you do or do not want to have children.

"Maybe its is time to try a different approach then.  I do intermittent fasting because I can't stick to diets either.

I think it has more to do with your blood sugar levels. Have you had yours checked? You can be thin but still have issues.

"Unfortunately it basically means going keto but I'm not as strict as that. You'll need to eat as few carbs as possible to improve your insulin resistance. No bread, rice, pasta etc anything made from flour. Sugar is also your major enemy sad to say so cut it out as much as you can. Those two are the main proven enemies of women with PCOS.  I've also cut out dairy because there's so many articles saying it's not good for PCOS due to the hormones in the milk messing with our already messed up hormones. Damn I hate Almond milk haha. Also they say to avoid soy because of the estrogen mimicing properties. Red meat is considered a food that causes inflammation which is already an issue in pcos.  If that's all too much to bear, just start getting rid of high carbohydrate and sugar foods and you should see results from that alone. Taking supplements like inositol is certainly very helpful but diet is essential too.

I say this because I used to have very long hair when my hair loss kicked in, and I went through the same grief of finding strands and clumps of hair everywhere and on my shoulders and arms, and came very close to buzzing it all off. A close friend urged me to only cut it just below the chin, before completely buzzing it, and I was actually pretty happy with it and didn't feel the urge to buzz it anymore.

"I don't see any people who are answering your question of what to do, so I'll try and help there as I've been r/TTC_PCOS since 11/2018.  Step 1: Get off birth control and find out what your cycles are like.  Pick up some ovulation tests: internet cheapies such as Easy@Home, not expensive ones like Clearblue because you'll likely need a lot.  Pick up a BBT thermometer that syncs to your phone, and use FertilityFriend, Premom, or something similar to find out if you are ovulating.  Let your doctor know you are trying, because there is typically a 12 month timer before getting a referral to an RE.  If any cycle goes more than 3 months, get an order of progesterone to trigger your next cycle since it's not safe to not cycle regularly.  If you are able to determine that your cycles are regular, time some intercourse in the few days before you ovulate.  If not, have sex as often are the pair of you are comfortable.  There's no need to do this more than every other day.  During this time try to focus on your general health.   Step 2:  Ordinarily I'd recommend you go right to an RE as a PCOS woman if the above doesn't work after 12 months, and skip your PCP/Obgyn altogether, because PCP and Obgyn are not very knowledgeable about fertility treatment.  \*Right\* now that's not really an option because almost all fertility clinics are shut due to C19.  If you start your 12 month wait now though, odds are good that they will be serving customers again by then.  You may want to check in with them a bit earlier to make sure to get on the waiting list.  My primary advice is to work on your current step, but always be planning for and aware of what the next step is. For PCOS that looks like   1. OPK+BBT at home for 12 months 2. Ovulation induction with letrozole with an obgyn or RE, 3-6 cycles or more if you're willing 3. IUI (maybe) with most likely RE 4. IVF with RE  Many women with PCOS are able to get pregnant without any intervention whatsoever.  Of those that don't, 1/3 are able to with ovulation induction.",/r/PCOS/comments/fl8a2k/so_my_partner_has_decided_he_wants_to_try/fkym2p1/,comment,2020-03-19 14:57:24-06:00

"My doctor told me that the whole ""cyst"" part of the name is really a misnomer.  It really refers to the fact that we have strings of immature egg follicles around our ovaries, and those are what are called the ""cysts"" (because they can look like it on ultrasound) of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  Really, though, they're infertile egg follicles that don't mature and don't ovulate because of our hormonal (testosterone) and metabolic (insulin resistance and weight issues) imbalances.  PCOS is not the same as those painful ovarian real cysts that can burst.  Of course, I know a lot of women on this thread might have both conditions, or even endometriosis too.  She also told me it's not cysts I have to worry about, but diabetes and increased endometrial cancer risk if I go too long without having a period.",/r/PCOS/comments/fl4e4a/what_if_i_dont_have_cysts_on_my_ovaries_but_have/fkxr9k9/,comment,2020-03-19 10:04:41-06:00

My husband and I are thinking about TTC again we had to have a break for a little while, we know it’s going to be tough going for a while but when and if it finally does happen it will be so worth it.

"I mean, technically. LHR is supposed to be considered hair REDUCTION more than REMOVAL...but it took me 3+ years for the hair to start growing back, and that's just because my hormones went a little more wacky than their ""normal"". The hair is also WAAAAAAYYYY more fine than before, and it's almost growing back in little patches that the lasers may have missed the first time. Instead of having to shave my face daily, we're talking like 1-3 months before it bothers me enough to have to do something about. With someone who used to have extreme dysphoria about it, this is the difference between night and day. I can't speak to the rest of my body because my face is the only place I was worried about.

"I made the decision to shave my head last May. I was so stressed with my hair thinning and wanted to try those cute pixie cuts. I knew that it would take a few months to get even a pixie AFTER shaving (blade and cream shave). I was proper bald baby! I'm only 28 but work remotely so I didn't stress about what the public would think. My family were stunned but supportive. I must say, it was so liberating and fun. My showers were much shorter and I took a lot less time getting ready. Trust me it didn't look great sporting a buzz cut, but once I had an inch or two of growth it looked like a cute pixie. I spotted headbands a lot to increase my feminine look.   My dad was actually the one to shave my head while my mom was filming. My scalp was so stimulated and felt good once it was done. I still used shampoo everyday (you need to) and I moisturized. Castor oil was rubbed on to my scalp daily which I think helped. Overall my hair seemed to grow in and appear thicker / healthier. Key word here is 'appear' because shaving doesn't actually create new hair follicles. But here I am, with nearly a bob and it's healthy and fuller. Overall be prepared to go a year or so before getting your hair towards a bob cut. Also be prepared to have ackward princess Diana layers / Joe dirt mullet. In the end, I don't regret doing it and will probably do it again sometime in the future, years down the road.",/r/PCOS/comments/fkz6py/does_anyone_else_just_ever_feel_like_buzzing/fkwx2e6/,comment,2020-03-19 03:21:11-06:00

"Hey. I'm sorry you're going through this. I know how it feels to not be believed about my symptoms and to have BC  and PCOS in general wreck havoc in my life. It's not at all wrong to want to pursue other methods of PCOS management. I personally have found luck with the hormonal IUD. I tried the pill as a teenager as well as the hormonal ring and found they both made me feel crazy and when I tried the pill again last year it made me so physically sick. The doctor that I had at that time was amazing and she told me to quit taking the pill immediately when I told her (unfortunately not the case in the past though...).  I've had the IUD for 2 years and it has changed my periods from super long and heavy to just a little bit of spotting once a month. I had a copper IUD first before I switched to a hormonal one and I never felt any of the side-effects from the pill or the ring. I don't know if that is an option for you or not. But to my knowledge, being on some form of birth control is really the only thing that can balance out your hormone levels and make periods more manageable, and it also protects you from further complications in the future. I still do get cramps though and I don't think the IUD being in there really helps lol. I have really mild other symptoms of PCOS so I can't really attest to how much it helps with the other symptoms. Just wanted to put this out there in case it can help you or someone else lol. There is also the depo shot or the skin patch that you could look in to? It's definitely okay to do your own research about birth control or symptoms you are feeling and then have a conversation with your doctor about it! A good doctor should be willing to listen and work with you to find something to manage your symptoms most ideally and you deserve be able to find that! I'm sorry you're having to deal with doctors who are not like this. Would it be an option to see another doctor at your clinic or try another clinic? I don't know what kind of things are available to you where you are. This all definitely isn't easy though - so I really empathize with you.

"I mean, I'm not a doctor but I'm pretty sure it helps with it indirectly, i.e. it helps the underlying insulin resistance that seems to lead to PCOS, and this leads to a reduction in testosterone being produced by the ovaries which allows ovulation to happen, and because you're ovulating then your other hormones fall into line. Honestly, metformin, low carb/keto and exercise have my cycles at 30-40 days and I'm pretty sure I ovulate most/all cycles. (Lean PCOS too). Keto and exericse help in a similar fashion by reducing insulin levels also.   It sounds like your doctors haven't been terribly helpful, but you at least don't need their help/permission to try low carb/keto and other lifestyle changes like exercise if that's what you want to do.

Do  not do bariatric surgeries before having seriously tried to eat an  health promoting diet. In fact these surgeries ruin your ability to  digest most natural plant foods.

"Welcome to the club sis. Where the ONLY options for PCOS are birth control, Spironolactone, and Merformin. None of these drugs even bring balance to our hormomes i.e. insulin, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, glucose. It just artificially keeps the symptoms at bay by masking them. It's only good if you take them for the rest of your life but the minute you try to ween off of them, you feel completely bamboozled.  The medical community regarding female hormonal imbalance is very interesting. We're supposed to rely on SYNTHETIC estrogen and progesterone pills to have a healthy feminine and non hyperandrogenic body yet they can't figure out how to naturally and permanently balance these hormones so our bodies can work efficiently WITHOUT drugs.   Imagine having to tell a future significant other that I have to rely on pills to look and feel like a healthy fertile woman in her prime childbearing years (20s)???

"Hi there!   To be diagnosed with PCOS you need TWO of these three.   1. High androgen levels (and the symtoms you have of excess facial hair and acne would suggest you have high androgens, have you had a blood test for testosterone?)   2. Irregular periods (which you have)   3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound   So if you meet the other two requirements, you dont need to have cysts to have polycystic ovary syndrome. It's a misnamed syndrome.   Also, polycystic ovary syndrome doesnt mean you can have kids! Lots of women with polycystic ovary syndrome can have kids. Maybe someone else can chime in in the specifics. I'm 18 and dont have a partner and am not interested in any of that right now so don't know a lot.

"Before keto, my diet consisted only of fast food, fried foods, rice, bread, chips, and candy. I had tried to lose weight since I was 12 (I’m 21 now) and nothing ever worked for me. I decided 2020 would be different. I was following some diet pages on here when I started eating healthy and exercising and 3 weeks in, I hadn’t lost a single pound. I remembered all the progress pictures I’d see on the keto page and I decided to just go for it. I didn’t know much about it but I knew keto meant I couldn’t eat anything that I did before. It was supposed to be really hard for someone like me but I love it and I feel amazing on it. I don’t really miss any of the food I ate before because there’s alternatives for everything. Mostly I just eat vegetables, protein, nuts, and sugar-free things if I’m really dying for them. Sugar-free tastes exactly like the real thing (especially with the candy). I can also make anything I wanted before, with the exception of fries. There’s really no alternative for them. If I want pizza, I take a cut da carb flatbread and I put a little pizza sauce and mozzarella on it and bake it. If I want fried chicken, I use almond flour. If I want chips, I go for Quest tortilla protein chips. I think keto sounds a lot harder than it is but for me, that was never the case. I just made sure that I always had my food ready for the next day because what makes any lifestyle change hard is not planning for it because then you’ll eat anything in front of you. I always packed things I looked forward to eating. In the first month and a half, I lost 25 pounds and dropped 5 BMI points. I’m not incredibly overweight so my results aren’t as impressive as others who have more weight to lose, but this is just my scenario. 25 pounds is still a lot, especially considering nothing made me lose weight before this. I believe in keto 100% and I think it’s incredible for PCOS women.",/r/PCOS/comments/fkisre/diet_keto_appetite/fkutkuf/,comment,2020-03-18 12:24:44-06:00

I was prescribed metformin + bc but I choose to only take the metformin because I knew that once I lost the weight my cycle would be normal. I was having a hard time losing weight because of the insulin resistance and metformin really helped with that. I personally didn't have any problems with metformin. I take sustained release. I get my vitamin D and B12 shots regularly. Also take a multi vitamin every day. I take the pill close to or right after a meal so I don't have any tummy issues. Make sure to eat a low carb diet and go vegan. Those things help a lot too.,/r/PCOS/comments/fkt6mp/metformin_for_acne/fkuoljo/,comment,2020-03-18 11:41:05-06:00

"It gets better the longer you do it! It can be pretty overwhelming at first. But the cravings do go away. I’ve been doing keto/ low carb (I add the second part because me and my boyfriend do cheat about once a week on a date night and I also do a more lazy/dirty approach as I don’t count things) and I am right at 40 lbs down since mid December! I’ve done keto before and lost 60 in 6 months but life got in the way and I went back to eating a bunch of crap and being in a toxic relationship.   The sweet craving goes away I promise! I get any sweet kick I want in with my morning coffee, I use pyure sweetener and sugar free French vanilla powdered cream. Other than that, I have an energy drink around lunch sometimes or gym time and then any sweet I wanted is taken care of. When I first started I tracked all my food, calories, carbs ect but i wanted to try and switch this to more of a lifestyle where I don’t have to think extra hard about it.  My boyfriend went on this journey with me and has also lost 35 lbs! :) our meals are pretty basic most of the time, and we kind of cycle through the same things to keep it easy. Breakfast I usually skip and IF most days, on The Weeknd’s I will make us breakfast burritos(eggs, bacon, cheese and mission low carb wrap). Lunches out are a little harder, we dont have many food options here I live in a very small town. If we go to pizza I eat the toppings, if we go to Mexican I eat just a side of meat or I get a half compuesta with no tortilla or beans so it’s basically lettuce, sour cream, small amount of pico and meat of my choice. Dinner is my favorite, we usually do a meat of some kind (steaks, porkchops, sometimes chicken) and then as a side we have mashed cauliflower (with sour cream and cheese added) and then some other veggie like asparagus, Brussels sprouts, green beans or broccoli. Sometimes I’ll do something fancy and make parm crusted pork chops or chicken Alfredo (no noodles) but usually we keep it simple but it’s delicious!   It’s now basically just a regular way to eat, I don’t have to think hard about what to cook or choose in the stores. And my appetite in general has really dropped, I’ve tried metformin and all it did was make me extremely hungry while also making me nauseas. This way has also leveled out my periods and I get one right on time each month, before I lost this 40 lbs between stress, hormones and weight I didn’t have one for like 7 months. :(",/r/PCOS/comments/fkisre/diet_keto_appetite/fkukvud/,comment,2020-03-18 11:08:09-06:00

"Go to planned parenthood and get on the birth control pill to help you temporarily. You don’t want to go too long without a period.   Go buy a cheap juicer and start juicing celery every single day. Stop eating processed foods and limit the amount of fats you intake. Stop eating gluten and wheat and stick to other whole grains like rice and whole oats. Try and fill your diet with mostly fruits and veggies of all kinds. I promise you will are a dramatic improvement and you will stop gaining weight. Your energy levels will skyrocket and your acne will literally go away if you have any. (I had severe cystic acne).   I have PCOS too (was diagnosed over 10 years ago and I’m 25) and I have struggled so much in the same ways you’re describing. but since I have found ways to make it way better (almost all symptoms gone) I have been reluctant to post on this thread because everyone is sooooo pro keto and pro metformin and pro bullshit methods bullshit doctors give you. You’re not alone in how you feel and what’s happening to your body.  If you want to actually cure your PCOS it’s not going to be easy at first but it WILL happen. And NOT through high fat keto diets. Look up Anthony Williams medical medium and listen to his podcast on PCOS. I don’t take any medications and I get my period every month. There’s not a lot of real information out there about PCOS and almost no one knows this, but it is actually caused by a viral overload of the same virus that causes strep. The Epstein Barr virus. And that’s what causes fluid filled cysts on our ovaries, that’s what causes acne, weight gain, liver problems, excess hair, adrenal problems, etc. this isn’t just some mystery condition that doctors don’t know shit about. No one is really doing research on women with PCOS. But honestly if you need a miracle cure (for anyone reading this) look up Anthony Williams. He is a slightly unorthodox dude, but if you actually try it (ESPECIALLY the celery juice) you will feel and see a massive improvement in your PCOS. I can’t stress this enough.   To each their own, but I will absolutely never put metformin in my body.   Plants will heal us as they are supposed to and I believe that till I die. But no one will ever get rid of PCOS eating trash processed foods, sorry it won’t happen. Maybe even consider being vegan. But carbs aren’t the enemy, it’s preservatives, processed foods, and a high fat diet that clogs your liver. With that being said, don’t eat cereals, breads, pizza, candy, cookies, etc. because those carbs will cause you to gain weight. But the carbs in fruit and whole grains like oats will not cause you to gain weight. Please just consider eating really clean and maybe even going vegan. Literally I gained 10 pounds one week from eating pizza one time... this shit is real. But celery juice I’m telling you.

"I know this will probably come off as rude, but what are you doing to try to lose weight on your own? Some people lose with keto, some just watching calories, etc. I myself am doing intermittent fasting and have lost 40 pounds in the past year. I could stand to lose about 10 more now so I will start exercising (walking outside) when the weather gets decent again. It didn't cost me any money to try it.  I have a friend who did keto. Although he is a male and doesn't have PCOS, he started at over 400 pounds. The weight just fell off of him. Once he dropped a little, we was able to start talking short walks for exercise. The more he lost, the more he was able to do. It took over a year, but he ended up losing 200+ pounds by changing his lifestyle.  I also have a sister-in-law who went the bariatric surgery route. I'll save the story of all the issues she had from the surgery.

Dinners usually consists of baked chicken and green beans, kielbasa with cheese and sauerkraut, bacon and eggs, or pulled pork carnitas with avocado.

"I've been keto for three years and it can be hard, especially at parties or around the holidays, but no medicine has ever come close to helping me manage my systems like this diet has. The good thing is that the longer you're on it the less frequent and intense those cravings become and luckily there are some keto alternatives out there anyway.   But really, what you need to succeed is the right mindset. If you tell yourself that keto is horribly restrictive and you can't have your favorite foods on it then you're setting yourself up to eventually fail. For me, framing my diet as medicine and carb-heavy foods as poisons (I know, I'm dramatic lol) has helped. By constantly reminding myself that carby foods make me feel sick and miserable while low carb foods make me feel good I feel less deprived emotionally and have been much more consistent with my diet since doing this.  I also caution against relying too heavily on keto replacements for carby foods. Too often I see people driving themselves crazy chasing perfect replicas and that never ends well. Just stick to the basic formula of protein+non-starchy veg and you'll be fine. Also also, if you're picky about veggies roast and saute them, it makes them taste *so good*.

"I've been on Metformin since 2002 and I'm 46. I was supposed to take 2000mg but could only handle 1500. I too suffered from daily acid reflux for years. I also never got over the daily diarrhea. One day about year and a half ago, I said screw it, I'm quitting the Metformin. Both the diarrhea and reflux went away instantly. I had no idea the reflux was from that. I was thrilled, but then a month or so after I quit the met, I started seeimg acanthosis nigricans patches developing under my breasts so I reluctantly restarted the Metformin. I started slowly because I had always had side effects. At 500mg, no side effects but still had the AN patches. At 1000mg, still no side effects but the AN patches went away. After doing blood work, my doctor said I could stay at that level so that is where I am now a year later.  Interesting about your doctor saying to expect rapid weight loss at the onset of menopause.

"Hey listen, I know it's terrifying. Our moods are all kinds of fucked from the no period, hormones flaring, constant pain, body issues, world dealing with this pandemic, etc etc etc. It will be ok. For now, do what you can. If you have a heat pack, use it. If not, lie on your stomach with a pillow on your lower abdomen area. It sounds painful but usually helps with cramps and ovarian pain to whoever I recommend it to.   As for the period thing--before I saw this vulvar specialist I didn't have a period for five years. This was mostly due to stress and a lot of other factors in my life. I am older now and don't have the condition I mentioned. Hopefully I'll never get that.   We were dealt a really shitty hand in life. I know it feels like your world is constantly, unendingly crumbling. But take a deep breath, watch a movie if you can't sleep, drink some hot tea without sugar. And relax. Don't even think about anything deep. You will be ok.

"I didn’t think I’d ever be able to do keto either, but I just hit two weeks and I feel amazing, and have already lost 12lbs.

I’ve honestly never felt more weak and exhausted in my life. My whole body was shaking and I had a constant headache for three days. But I listened to everyone who cheered me on and promised it would get better, and I would encourage you to do the same. Before keto, I lived in a blood sugar prison. I had to eat every two to three hours, or else suffer a blood sugar crash... sweaty, nauseous, shakes. Getting on the keto diet completely resolved this for me (and I’m only two weeks in!) I am honestly rarely hungry now, and cravings have mostly dissipated. I feel so proud of myself now - I never ever ever thought I could tolerate getting into keto, but I did. I feel confident, have more energy, and I’m free from my blood sugar prison. The transition is very very tough, but the pay off is more than worth it. I would really encourage you to give it a try.

I think birth control is much more drastic, but that's just my opinion as I don't like the idea of hormones trying to fix hormones. Plus, if you're TTC in the future- being on birth control for a long time can cause issues. I've heard a lot more horror stories about BC than Metformin, but then again, it's not very common so maybe that's why there isn't much widespread information.   From what I researched, metformin actually helps a lot of PCOS women lose weight- which is what you seem to be struggling the most with. I would really consider looking into it.

"You will likely be sat down and asked why you are there, you can say PCOS and list your symptoms (we all have different ones). Also useful to share is if you are sexually active or not (especially given you are young), they should ask, but share this info if they don't.  The doctor will likely suggest solutions that address your symptoms, the most used is the contraceptive pill. Mention if you suffer from any other things like migraines, depression, blood clots, high blood pressure, heart conditions as these are side effects of some pills. If you already suffer from them, the doctor might choose a different formulation of the pill that has a lower likelihood to cause those side effects or avoid prescribing the pill altogether.  If you do not wish to take the contraceptive pill, tell the doctor why and know you can ask about other treatment options. They should be open to offering alternatives or tell you they are not sure of what else could work well and will look it up.  They might do an internal exam or a pelvic ultrasound if you haven't had one already. Speculums, what they use to open the vaginal canal, are not the most comfortable but are usually ok. They are also usually cold due to the kind of substance/lubes they put on it. If you are apprehensive about this exam, tell the doctor and ask them to explain exactly what they are going to do.  A medical professional should be straightforward, open and calm in the way they relate to you, especially if they see you are under any stress.  Ask about PCOS. I don't know how it works in your country, where I am the gynecologist is the doctor that will manage it (some places it's the GP, others the endocrinologist). Ask them to explain the condition and what it entails fertility wise, ask them to describe common symptoms and ask especially about the heightened risk of obesity and diabetes. It might be small in your case but it's good to get the facts straight from a medical professional when you've just been diagnosed.",/r/PCOS/comments/fkdbzj/first_gynecologist_appointment_in_2_days_what/fks472s/,comment,2020-03-17 15:52:08-06:00

"Sorry to hear about your diagnosis!  I was diagnosed 4 years ago, and for me, really it was one of the better things for my health. Learning to test my blood sugar regularly and ""eat to my meter"" has been super helpful.  I wish I would have known like 4 years prior to diagnosis how to eat for my body so that I wouldn't have become diabetic, but sans that, at least I finally learned.  If at all possible, I would recommend getting a CGM with inexpensive sensors such as the Libre Freestyle so that you can test easily without poking your finger all the time.  It removes all the barriers from testing so you can make all your carb decisions around your ""carb budget"" based on your current blood sugar, and makes it super easy to see how things like pizza and ice cream affect your specific body.  Any way, what really matters for your blood sugar is the amount of carbs you eat and how much time you put between those meals.  You learn this really fast with a CGM. There's a great book ""The Diabetes Code"" by Dr. Jason Fung that can teach you a lot about how to live a long and healthy life with diabetes.    FWIW, I changed to a low carb diet and as of 4 years later, have kept my a1c below 6.0 since about 5 months after diagnosis.  (It takes time for your blood sugars to re-normalize if you do it slowly without insulin.)  These days I mostly keep around a 5.0 with about 20-60g carbs per day and metformin only, using my CGM as a guide for how much I can afford at each meal.  At this a1c my odds of disease progression or side-effects are very minimal.  You can do it!",/r/PCOS/comments/fk6wfx/diagnosed_with_diabetes_now/fkrscda/,comment,2020-03-17 13:57:35-06:00

You really have to play with the range to find what works and is sustainable.  I did keto for a few months and it did help my symptoms but I couldn't do it (didn't like doing completely different dinners from my family).  I found a range of 50-100g of carbs worked for me in helping my symptoms but allow me to still not have to make two dinners.  It also depends on how much you want to make from scratch. I found it easier to do low carb when I made some of the food in large batches to portion out later (like zucchini egg bread or fat bombs.).  And find a good tracker app and use it daily (I log each meal as I plan them or making them).

"I get what you mean. PCOS can be extremely difficult to deal with.   But please remember that you owe it to yourself to take care of your health and avoid self harming habits such as unhealthy food. It will only make things worse and you deserve so much better!   Many of the symptoms of PCOS can be managed with the proper diet, medication, supplements, etc. It’s just that the internet likes to catastrophize things and make it feel like things are more impossible than they are.   That’s why I try to avoid a lot of online forums because although there is a wealth of information there is a ton of negativity as well and you don’t need to have that bad energy in your life. Focus on the success stories rather than the “woe is me”.   I highly recommend that you research more about the condition and get a good support group of medical professionals such as your GP, OBGYN, Endocrinologist , etc so that you can figure out what’s the best way to go about this journey.   Some books that have really helped me during this time was “ The Period Repair Manual” by Lara Briden and “ 8 steps to reverse your PCOS” from Fiona McCulloch if you are interested in a more natural approach.   Remember that you are not alone and there are so many women with PCOS that lead successful lives and have no trouble finding lovers and friendships. You’ve got this!

"Start with baby steps. Lower the amount of carbs you're eating now. Maybe even just reducing added sugar and then completely eliminating it. Then maybe you can reduce overall carb intake. Everyone is different. For reference, I am short, and I've tried both keto and low carb. I've had the best luck with keto, but it was not sustainable for me. So after a year of keto I've switched to low- moderate carb (60g-100 g net carb). Typically for keto low carb is 20-60g (60g is after you're fat adapted and really depends on the person). Lazy low carb for some is under 100g, for others anything over 60g is moderate carb. So, you have to try it yourself and see. I'm sorry that this isn't a straightforward answer, but the overall advice is just to do what you can to reduce carbs. Take it slowly. Try low carb first and then if that doesn't work, try keto. Try things that are sustainable because PCOS is life-long.",/r/PCOS/comments/fk905r/keto_vs_low_carb/fkrfwhh/,comment,2020-03-17 12:01:09-06:00

"the short answer is there is no definitive answer. find what works for you... I'd recommend starting with just overall low carb, 100-150g/day and see what it does for you. what if any symptom relief do you get, how are your energy levels, etc. then lower your carb intake as needed.

I had a similar experience on the second BC they made me try! I also felt like my moods were out of control and the pills made me depressed af. My only issue was the excess facial hair too which was as bad as you’re describing yours to be. My doctor was able to prescribe a cream for my facial hair called Vaniqa /Eflornithine and this made a huuuuge difference. I stopped taking the pills and just use the cream twice a day and I shave like once every 2 days now - which still isn’t amazing I guess but definitely beats having to shave twice a day. You could see a different doctor and ask about this cream maybe? If you don’t like your current doctor.. but also I’d recommend for you to look into natural ways to reduce your male hormones (such as weight loss etc.) because this is something I wish I would have taken more seriously as my hair started thinning badly now because of it.,/r/PCOS/comments/fk0pvd/meds_seem_worse_off/fkqc4ks/,comment,2020-03-17 04:11:03-06:00

"No. You are unnecessarily overcomplicating things/getting ahead of yourself.  If you think the fatigue might be due to spiro, then it would be entirely reasonable to call the prescribing doctor (I'm guessing the dermatologist in this case), say ""I have been experiencing x,y,z since starting this drug, is this a known side effect and if so what can we do about it?"" If they say ""no it's not a known side effect"" then you could ask if they have any recommendations e.g. see your normal doctor, see x type of doctor. If they do know that it's a normal side effect, then they should know what to do to manage it.  If your dermatologist is no help, then go to your NORMAL doctor and tell them about it. Don't try to predict what kind of doctor you need based on one symptom. Part of the point of your GP is that they can identify if you need a specialist and if so what kind of specialist you need. That's probably money better spent (assuming you're American) than potentially going to a random doctor who can't help you because the issue is not even remotely related.  I'm not a doctor but I'm willing to bet that fatigue is not a muscle/bone problem.

"I sprinkle some amount of flax mill pretty much everywhere: a bit to omelettes, the rare pancake, salads - most of the time I don't even notice it's there.

I cook schnitzel-like meat slices in the coating of flaxseed mill and chopped pecans  - sort of like breaded meat, but after eggs comes a layer of flaxseed mill and chopped nuts. I also add it homemade pesto and mix in with marinara when I make tomato basil pasta.   Finally, you can just bring 1 TBSP flaxmill / cup of water to a boil, immediately turn off (it can boil over like milk) and drink as a sort of pudding/jelly kind of drink on its own, a kissel.

That being said, I ended up dropping the whole thing and the treatment of 9 months left me worse off than I was before going on the pill - then again, some people have great results with it. Personally, I concluded that the only side of the PCOS which the pill is an actual solution to - is the risk of endometriosis caused by lack of period. Weight, acne, hair, etc - are caused by hyperandrogeny and Insulin resistance, and thus should be addressed directly, by anti-androgen drugs (such as Spiro) and insulin sensitizers (such as metformin, among others) - it's not a quick journey, but theoretically, once the IR is in check and androgen levels are under control, the rest should improve, too.

"I’ve actually been working from home for 2 years now, and I can assure you, it gets better. There’s definitely going to be a learning curve at the beginning, it’s an entirely new routine you’re getting used to. Here’s how I manage to stay on track and stay sane:   1. Get ready for the day. Don’t treat it any different than going to your regular job. Wake up at the same time, wash your face, brush your teeth and your hair.  2. Create separation. If you’re able to, create a work space that is separate then where you normally spend your time. Leave this space entirely on your breaks! 3. Plan your meals. I still pack a lunch and snacks the night before, this forces me to put thought into what I’m eating and not just grabbing what sounds good.  4. Remove temptation. You don’t want to be tempted to eat something then don’t buy it. Out of sight, out of mind (eventually).  5. Move regularly. Thank god for YouTube, I haven’t paid for a fitness class in years because of all the free content.

"I have no idea about duramine, but if you just want to quickly lose 5kg, your best bet will likely be to severely cut carbohydrates. Basically make most of your food intake vegetables, and then add in protein - meat, tofu, beans, eggs, cheese, lentils, other plant-based proteins, etc. Cutting dairy IMO will make cutting carbs harder at first, but is totally up to you and you can get plenty of nutrients in without it. Also, when severely limiting carbs, you can and should be getting plenty of healthy fats. You need them to keep you full.   Personally I don't think that  super low carb diets like Keto (basically what I explained above) work on a long-term basis for most people (it absolutely does for some, but for most people these super restrictive diets don't work long term). However, those with PCOS do tend to respond quite well to very low carb diets, and it can be an excellent jump start for your weight loss where you eat very little carbs and then over time you perhaps slowly start adding them back.   Some possible meal options:  Breakfast - eggs with a breakfast meat are a very common option. Depending on how low carb you're willing to go, you could try like a breakfast taco/burrito with a low-carb wrap, or some avocado toast. Those will both absolutely contain carbs though, so in the beginning it might just be better to go without. Those sous vide egg bites are a good option. You can also skip food and do one of those high-fat coffee drinks - its usually black coffee with either grass-fed butter or MCT oil and maybe some heavy cream.   Snacks - nuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs, raw veggies + dip (check the carbs in the dip)  Lunch/dinner - I love doing bowls with lots of different veggies + some protein + a sauce of some sort. Pinterest has a bazillion ideas. People often call them ""buddah bowls."" Some people add carbs like rice or noodles but you don't have to.

"Yeah, pretty much. But I see a lot of people saying things like: ""couldn't maintain it""; ""too restrictive""; ""not intuitive"" after eating their weight goal and making a comeback to carbs (which, not going to lie, is hard on your gut and mood).   2 weeks ago I was still having a huge fear of carbs. It did goes down little by little. I tracked my entire week and i've been eating OMAD (fasting in average 22hours) and I was eating around 140g of carbs a day. Not feeling hungry if I add good fats and small portion of protein. And my carbs were mainly whole grains bread (the small and fine bread which has like 25g per slide) and today oatmeal with plain yogurt and cacao.     I do feel like OMAD has really helped me to get over this fear aswell. But, if you want my main tip: when you eat any type of carbs, make sure it's whole af. Always think of fiber first then your carb.      I do like this: main fiber meal with vegetables &gt; fat for flavorings (and I don't hesitate on that, I make sure to put a lot of butter/olive oil) &gt; protein (which for me would be 2 eggs or some cheese). And then, since i'm on IF (mostly OMAD), I make sure to have a healthy dessert meal, in my case, today was 2 plain yogurt with 1tbsp of cacao and 50g of oatmeal. I mostly prefer potatoes but I've any in my house right now (which makes me so sad lmao).     And I feel great. Hope my story could help about your fear of carbs. Perhaps, tracking 1 week or 2 your foods could help you first and then get into intuitive eating.

"It's all explained very well at [plantpositive.com](https://plantpositive.com). I summarize for you.  If you eat plenty of animal foods and fat, and you get overweight and sedentary as a result, then your body lose the ability to process properly the high carb foods. Your body will try to produce a lot of insulin when you eat these foods and this excess insulin will trigger problems in susceptible people (like most people with PCOS). Eventually for many people the body loses the ability to produce that much insulin and their blood glucose level will go up and they get diagnosed with diabetes.  At this stage there are two reasonable ways to move forward: you can eliminate all the high carb foods and eat almost exclusively animal foods and fat or you recognize the past errors and you fix them. Most people don't like to admit their errors and they prefer to insist with the wrong foods. They get their insulin and blood glucose under control but they do not get general health. You can't fix the body with this trick.",/r/PCOS/comments/fjjv5o/tired_been_trying_to_ignore_it_but_need_some/fknum8f/,comment,2020-03-16 09:57:31-06:00

"I’m like this. What I think is similar to what someone said earlier on, finding something that works best for both of you. My husband is really handsome and sexy and yet I feel like it’s a chore to have sex sometimes. Probably because our idea of passion is different. I want him to be all over my body but he just goes to key places of interest for him.   We haven’t had sex in a while because of Pregnancy but what helped before was having that once a week time. Ritually lighting candles and appealing to my mood because it’s harder for me to get in the head space.   We downloaded Gottman Card Decks to kick start conversation because I really need to feel he listens to me and wants to know about me as foreplay. We try to go slower and I try to not tell him what I need but lead without words. This is hard.  I also try and make myself relaxed by having a shower before and having a tidy space.   Honestly I don’t like that I rather get turned in alone but I know that it is probably easier and quicker so that’s why I do it. What I learned though is that sometimes is what the problem is. I think I should give him a chance to do it for me rather than me doing it myself. Its really hard I know but for women the sex organ we need most involved is our brain and we have to find the time cultivate that head space.  I don’t ask for back rubs but when I can’t get there I ask for him to lightly rub his hands over my body. Makes me tingly and get chills. I also tell him not to go near my nether regions and tease. Teasing helps my head to begin to anticipate things. Get some nice smelling candles and try and overwhelm your senses so your head gets caught up in it. Whatever you think you need to do this.  I like the idea of therapy to help you figure it out. But yah, I’m in your same boat. I’m so out of practice initiating it is so hard now. I haven’t been able to kiss my husband in months because I keep getting colds and pregnancy with a cold messes me up bad. I got the biggest cold sore in my life and now it’s scarring uggh.

This could be caused by low testosterone. Testosterone regulates libido in women as well as men Most people with pcos have high levels of testosterone but increasing estrogen levels will suppress testosterone. Have your doctor check your t levels and if any of your medication or lifestyle choices lowers testosterone production or decreases androgen sensitivity. It’s relatively cheap to supplement testosterone levels with pills/gel if it comes to that.   Not all ssri s affect libido the same. Wellbutrin in particular is known for not suppressing libido.,/r/PCOS/comments/fjdrdx/i_need_sex_help_please_asap/fknriro/,comment,2020-03-16 09:26:48-06:00

For example, my recommended videos included “Low Libido and Your Partner”, “Where to start”, “Anatomy Lessons”, etc. All things to give you an educational perspective. Dipsea is a library of brief naughty audio stories...I haven’t found them to be crazy explicit but rather tasteful.

"Hey there 👋🏼 I think looking at this issue holistically would be a really approach; physically, emotionally, sexually.   Maybe once the social distancing is over, mentioning this to a doctor would be good, as imbalances in the body can lead to libido changes.  Also I think some sort of therapy or counseling from a trained professional would be helpful ♡ They can help get to the emotional root of it (if any), or help give you resources on how to deal with this whole thing emotionally while you are still figuring out the other aspects? I am a big proponent for therapy for *everyone* (especially for me hahaha)  And sexually, I know I’m going to get some pushback, but I think taking some time to get to know your body and what feels good to you (aka masturbation) could really help you figure out if the reason your libido is low is because it really is low or if your sexual needs are not being met during sex (sorry if that sounds a lil harsh, not trying to pass judgement on your husband or anything). But yeah, maybe there are different sexual acts or ways those acts are approached that feel better to you/ turn you on more.

"Did you talk to your doctor at all about options in addition to weight loss? I'm sure that it can help with the process, but it's by no means the only thing that causes PCOS or it's related symptoms and other avenues of treatment may actually help make weight loss easier.   I've just recently been diagnosed and it's been a frustrating journey mainly because my doctors didn't seem to believe that it was something that could affect someone of my small body type. The reflexive response of doctors to require weight loss before pursuing other avenues of treatments can be very detrimental to women's physical health and mental well-being.",/r/PCOS/comments/fjgfk5/im_so_frustrated/fkmw4x5/,comment,2020-03-16 01:06:41-06:00
"I also have very low libido. What I eventually worked through was trying to make myself feel “sexy.” That is not an easy task. I don’t like my body. I don’t like myself a lot of days. But I would do whatever it took to try and get myself in the headspace.   I’d put on cute outfits. I’d do my hair. I’d put on makeup. I’d take pics of myself. I’d watch porn. I’d try to masturabte. Whatever it took to try and get me in that headspace. Then, when I finally was feeling SOMETHING (didn’t even have to be horny. Just. SOMETHING), I’d go try to initiate. It took a long time. It took a lot of trial and error. And it’s not a perfect system.   Since getting pregnant again, the sex drive died 110% again. But once we make it through this, I’ll do my best to start the process over. I don’t know if that’ll be helpful to you or not, but it’s the one thing I really tried and worked on",/r/PCOS/comments/fjdrdx/i_need_sex_help_please_asap/fkmvz0g/,comment,2020-03-16 01:03:30-06:00
"Well yes, losing weight for us is harder but not impossible. First of all, get used to the idea that you'll have to live with this the rest of your life, so indulging in junk food whenever you feel frustrated  is not longer an option, you won't accomplish anything by giving up. Actually, if you want to see some progress you may want to cut carbs (sugar spikes/levels and insuline resistance are mayor players in PCOS sympthoms). See a dietitian about a plan that works for you.    And again, be strong. Hirsutism, thinning hair, irregular periods, you name it, is part of who you are now that won't go away so you should love yourself regardless, you have no choice lol.  Besides, there are so many treatments for everything nowadays, take it as an adventure. I like experimenting with hair products to see what works the best.  So far hair botox was a major win for my thin hair, it's shiny and looking alive again. For facial hair there's laser, but after 20 years  of treatment I sort of gave up and moved to basic plucking and electric razor. Still a hassle to do it everyday, but is not as painful or time consuming.   You see what I mean, you're young, you have your whole life to try stuff and see what works the best for you, don't worry.     And to be honest, f\*\*k this instagram culture.

see I don’t think what hurts him is the not having sex. It’s that I never initiate I never try. We aren’t romantic and it’s not that we don’t love each other we’re actually very lovey Dover it’s just we’re not. Date night people. We don’t take the time to spend together and when we do it feels forced? Because it’s not our jam lol we opted out of writing our own wedding vows because we’re “I love you I appreciate you I need you I want you” daily in life. I just can’t get sexually aroused by him or anyone or anything. I’m definitely not gay. I think it’s my anxiety my depression and the fact that I don’t sleep well at all I have a tumor on the gland in my brain that controls sleep. Among other things. My testosterone is high but I can’t take the medication to lower it because it affects my heart. So what I can control is coming down on my SSRI. Trying to get back into shape. And hopefully combined those two will give me more energy to do stuff.,/r/PCOS/comments/fjdrdx/i_need_sex_help_please_asap/fkmvbv0/,comment,2020-03-16 00:51:17-06:00

"So, different options: 1. Something hormonal might be going on, affecting your sex drive 2. You might be depressed and lack desire in general, including your desire for sex 3. You might be very context sensitive to get in the mood, if there isn't enough build up, no desire is awakened 4. You might be exhausted, if you have a lot of things going on, you might simply be too tired for sex, feels like anassignment 5. You might be too anxious, for Sox you need to be relaxed, letting it happen, if you are anxious you won't enjoy it and feels like an assignmment 6. You might be holding a grudge. Being mad and getting close/feeling the love don't match well for most people 7. Feeling unsave. Sex is vulnerable, if you feel unsave in your partners arms then sex is not desired at all. This might be due to your partners behavior or childhood wounds that not have healed 8. Sexual abuse. Sex gets way more complicated to desire if very bad experiences are related to it  9. You might just be this way and be on the asexual spectrum somewhere. There are many flavors. It is ok to be asexual, if you are it will be freeing to finally know that you simply have less desire, and you are perfectly normal 10. You might be gay. Many woman are confused because they fantasize about men, but in real life it doesn't do much for them. It can take years to figure out and can be quite confusing.  11. Sexual experiences with your husband been bad, so now the thought of sleeping with him is a 'naaaah..' instead of a 'yaaaay'. In that case I recommend reading 'come as you are' and thereafter 'the erotic mind'  Whatever it may be, try to approach this in a curious manner, you are going on a road of self discovery!! Ask for help along the way if you need experts or someone who knows smit to listen to you.   Please tell your husband you are making an effort to find out.

"I was very disheartened and felt so lost when I first got diagnosed too! It felt like I didn't even know where to begin or what to do next. Luckily my sister snapped me out of it and kind of just told me what to do; so now I try to pass on the things that helped me whenever I can to whomever I can. There is a lot you can do!  You can do a lot to manage (or even reverse!) your PCOS symptoms and get your body back to more of a 'normal' state. The downside of PCOS is that it presents itself differently in everyone and everyone seems to respond differently to treatments, so you sort of need to use trial and error to figure out what works best for you. The book ""8 Steps to Reverse Your PCOS"" by Fiona McCulloch was so helpful when I was getting started. She explains pcos so well and she helps you figure out the areas of your pcos you need to address first. She also gives blood tests to have your doctor run to help with further diagnoses, as well as giving information about how to decode the results. That book is a huge resource!  Next, I made major diet changes. Some people do keto, but I've had the most success by following Whole30 or Paleo. It was just easier for me, and it addresses inflammation the best (inflammation was a huge area I needed to work on based off of the book). I did a Whole30 to get started and then followed the paleo diet after that (basically the same thing, but you're allowed natural sweeteners like maple syrup or honey). That diet change helped a ton and only got better the longer I did it!   Exercise is another important component. 75 minutes total per week is optimal for pcos (more than that can cause issues). I do a 25 minute workout 3 days a week.   Another thing I did was switch all of my products (body wash, hand soap, lotion, cleaning products, deodorant, etc) to natural, minimal ingredient ones. Hormone disruption is caused by a lot of chemicals in popular products. I'd be happy to give you a run down of all of the products I switched to!  Finally, if you are thinking about ttc anytime in the near future, it may be a good time to see a doctor now. I've had the best luck with my Natural Procreative (NaPro) doctor. They're a little hard to find, but my doc has helped me fix my issues better than any other doctor i saw instead of just throwing fertility drugs at me and hoping for the best. They are religiously affiliated, so that can sometimes cause issues, but I really liked the more natural approach and was already charting my cycles anyway. Other people have good luck with Reproductive Endocrinologists.   I'd be happy to help you in any way that I can, just let me know. I remember that horrible feeling of not knowing what to do and feeling kind of hopeless. Best of luck to you!

"Sawadee kah from Europe.  It sounds like you’ve gone through a fair share of tough times, and I understand how frustrating it feel when you’re newly diagnosed. But let me tell you, I think everything is going to be okay. I say that because you found out you have PCOS. Although PCOS is by no means a walk in the park, it is a diagnosis that enables you to now zoom in on treatment targeted to manage PCOS.  For example, some might think that overweight ladies should just exercise a whole lot to lose weight. But if you have PCOS, you should be cautious with high intensity exercise because it messes with your hormones!  So try to google some resources in English on how to manage - there is plenty out there. A tip as well is to revisit birth control with your doctor - ask for alternative brands or try other methods (NuvaRing, although this is not for everybody).

"I had gastric bypass on 12/14/18 and I’ve got PCOS. It helped a lot to be honest. I went from 306 to 199 in that time. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my mood and energy levels. Obviously weighing 100#’s less helps with that, but I felt like my funky hormones were also a cause. I started taking Spironalactone for my acne and that’s helping, but I’ve got some more things to sort out when it comes to my (almost) periods that my Mirena pretty much prevents.   Your insurance may require you to take some nutrition classes prior to the surgery as a requirement. They’re super helpful, but you’ll need to be prepared to learn a lot on your own. I’d highly recommend therapy for the first year to really talk through why you deviated from the food plan they’ll give you. I discovered a lot about my mental health when I took the time to talk out my addiction to food.   It took me awhile to come to terms with using my food intake as a way to get the most nutrition I possibly could. It’s not easy to make the lifestyle change and you’re going to have to sacrifice a lot. I’ve learned which foods my body doesn’t tolerate anymore by whether they cause me pain or not and that’s been suuuuuuper fun. (/s) I went vegetarian for the most part because meat is just hard to eat now. You also get to eat more when you’re eating straight vegetables. Your relationship with food changes when it physically hurts you.   I also watch my sugar intake religiously - so much so that I got a tattoo of the molecular structure of sugar on my right wrist. The hand I eat with. It still gets me though. I just experienced dumping the other night after eating part of a cupcake that I was handed and I just shoved it into my mouth without being mindful. My boyfriend had to rub my shoulders on our friends porch as my fright response was triggered from the increased heart rate and I was sobbing uncontrollably.   Beware of alcohol as well. Your body will process it much fast which could turn into an unhealthy coping mechanism real fast if you deal with other parts of your life that cause you stress. (Job for me)  It’s an every day battle and starting group fitness classes helped a lot. I started doing yoga where they taught a lot of self healing/love yourself mantras during the classes and having someone tell you to love yourself gives you a lot of motivation and is just plain soul refreshing.   Anywho, if you’re like me and needed a reset button on the way you were taught to eat and we’re fucked in the genetic hormone lottery, I’d definitely recommend it. Changed my life and even with it being one of the most difficult things I’ve done, I’d still do it again in a heart beat.

"&gt;I was hclf vegan in 2016-2017 and completely lost my period for those two years. It doesn’t work for me.  There are some bad hclf vegan diets, basically, the raw vegan diets. Maybe you did these diets? The problem of these diets is that they're based on false premises. The [garbage in garbage out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out) principle applies to nutrition science.  I think it's fair to customize the diet for the individual. At the same time it's also fair to try to get the basics right before thinking about the customization.  \&gt;In regards to my blood tests the only thing i changed in that period of time was supplementation \[vit D, b12, magnesium, alpha lipoic acid, reishi, and zinc\] and spearamint tea.  Well this is a nice mystery there. Maybe someone else can answer it. ALA at what dosage? Tell us the dosages because these ""vitamins"" and ""supplements"" are basically drugs and you've to be careful about dosages.  \&gt;I already eat a fairly “healthy diet” of whole foods from animals and  plants. I eat carbs and fats, honestly i should up my protein and lower both other macros. I plan on changing my diet soon but have been  researching extensively what i want to do so in the mean time i have  changed absolutely nothing. Ive always avoided dairy and gluten except  for occasionally.  I would suggest you forget about macros. Think about foods. Macros barely matter at all. Yes protein stimulates anabolic hormones but it's **not** the proper way to stimulate anabolic hormones. What's proper way? It's exercise.  I mean if you want to get best score on OGTT test you've to do high carb, in addition of whole foods and low animal foods, but of course having the best score at OGTT is worth nothing if you still have the unpleasant symptoms.  \&gt;But from one month to another nothing has changed. No calorie reduction.  Absolutely nothing. Thats why i am confused on why my testosterone  lowered so dramatically ect. My symptoms are still here. I feel  terrible. Acne, hair loss, more body fat than i’d like. I’m not trying  to portray that these changes in my bloods were because of the  supplementation ar all, i’m just stating that 1000% honestly thats the  only thing i changed. Which is what led me to asking about it. I have  been sleeping a little more i guess? Because like i told you above i’ve  been burnt out.  Well if symptoms are still there then you've not solved anything really...  \&gt;I didn’t fast for any longer. Maybe an hour at best. I don’t remember  what my last meals were before either of the tests but if i had to guess  it was some combination of a protein (likely fish or chicken) a carb  from brown rice or sweet potato ect. Some veg. and fats from dark  chocolate or fruit and almond butter after dinner. I eat relatively  similar foods everyday just in varying amounts. I don’t eat fast food or  even out at restaurants very often.  It could be the last meal somehow normalized hormones temporarily. The hormones fluctuate on a daily to daily basis.

"I was hclf vegan in 2016-2017 and completely lost my period for those two years. It doesn’t work for me.   In regards to my blood tests the only thing i changed in that period of time was supplementation and spearamint tea. I already eat a fairly “healthy diet” of whole foods from animals and plants. I eat carbs and fats, honestly i should up my protein and lower both other macros. I plan on changing my diet soon but have been researching extensively what i want to do so in the mean time i have changed absolutely nothing. Ive always avoided dairy and gluten except for occasionally. But from one month to another nothing has changed. No calorie reduction. Absolutely nothing. Thats why i am confused on why my testosterone lowered so dramatically ect. My symptoms are still here. I feel terrible. Acne, hair loss, more body fat than i’d like. I’m not trying to portray that these changes in my bloods were because of the supplementation ar all, i’m just stating that 1000% honestly thats the only thing i changed.

"No carbs and no fat?  So your doctor wants you eat nothing but lean meat with no vegetables?  That's stupid.  If you lower your carbs you have to compensate by having the percentage of macronutrients of protein or fat go up.  So you could go with a carnivore diet, but a carnivore diet with no fat would restrict your meat choices so much that you would become ill from lack of nutrients.  Even those who follow the carnivore diet know that some amount of fat is necessary to get a wide variety of nutrients.  I would try a keto diet if you want to do something that's truly hardcore.  That will force you to cut out all processed and refined carbs and stick with only non-starchy (low carb) veggies and various kinds of meat. Don't avoid fats from meat, but try not to overdo it with cheese and low carb milk products, although you don't have to avoid them entirely.

"I had undiagnosed PCOS until I was 32. I kept going to doctors asking them to test me for PCOS since I was in my teens and they all refused. I had all the symptoms, but no one wanted to help me. I had the lap band done when I was 22. I lost over 100 pounds and have kept most of it off a decade later. I still have PCOS, but I would have ended up on “My 600 pound life” had I been left to my own devices.  Research all of the surgeries to see which one fits you. The sleeve and Gastric Bypass seem to give great amounts of weight loss in the quickest amount of time, but they’re also easy to get around and many people gain all their weight back because they over eat and stretch their stomachs out.  For me the band was slow going, it took 9 months before I even felt “restriction.”  Other than my hormones I also have an unhealthy relationship with food. So weight loss surgery can help with some things, but it doesn’t fix everything.  If you want to get surgery and you think it’s the right thing for you, then do it.

And I've never been able to lift really heavy but luckily put on muscle easy enough to notice some change from minimal training.

"There are formal criteria to diagnose PCOS. It definitely sounds like you have it to me. They are called the Rotterdam criteria and are the only accepted way to diagnose PCOS. You must have at least 2/3 of 1. Irregular periods, 2. Signs of high testosterone either in blood work or through symptoms like acne, excessive hair growth, etc, 3. Cysts on your ovaries on ultrasound. It sounds like you meet all 3 criteria which must be considered prior to starting any birth control pills or similar hormone based contraception. Many women with PCOS tend to be overweight, but it is not an actual criteria. Also as you said, being Asian, he should take into account that your excessive hair growth may be less severe than people from other cultures.  The only way you would not have PCOS is if he diagnoses another condition that can account for all your symptoms (I.e. like non classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia- but unless he has done this, you have PCOS if he can’t find another more specific diagnosis).

"Same re: the fat distribution. I find that wearing an oversized shirt with a pair of shorts or a shorter skirt helps (I mean, I do that bc I'm lazy but it also shows off dem chicken legs). A lot of harajuku cute aesthetic sort of fashion has that style, so you can look to it for inspo. Longer hair can help frame your face, although personally it isn't my style.  I find that flared dresses still help to create the illusion of an hourglass-ish figure even if you are apple shaped (of course it works even better for those who are pear shaped).

Depression causes people to neglect themselves and interfere with healthy choices, be it food, exercise, hygiene, etc.  Unless you have PCOS, unless you're a woman with a beard, or an overweight woman, a woman affected by having too much testosterone through no fault of her own, a woman who has irregular periods or a woman who can hardly get out of bed and just MIGHT for a fucking cupcake, keep your opinions to yourself.",/r/PCOS/comments/fi0di1/i_think_im_going_to_grow_out_my_beard/fkg9s7s/,comment,2020-03-13 20:40:14-06:00

"&gt;Nope, she asked for tips on how to grow it. Not for your opinion on her looks.  The fact almost all men in our societies shave regularly should tell you what's the common opinion on how to grow a beard. I've given her an honest opinion.  &gt;I think plant-based diets may help to an extent, but it's not a cure all.  We're in complete agreement.  &gt;The reason for the low carb, if you have read many posts here, is because PCOS-ers tend to be insulin resistant.  It seems so (there are some studies matched for adiposity) but diet could change all this. Or maybe not. I don't know.  &gt;Even when I eat whole plant food high in carbs (grains and fruit) I show symptoms of insulin resistance.  You've to eat **only** the food high in carbs to **cure** insulin resistance effectively. If you've tried this and failed then I'm interested in your story. If not then it's the usual story of someone eating some high carb foods in the context of a low carb diet.  &gt;The seed cycling is a thing I do for PCOS. It's supposed to help regulate my hormonal cycle naturally. The supplements are also to help with PCOS.  I hope all these tricks work. Which seeds and supplements they're?  I've made some comments on 3 popular supplements/drugs in another post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/fhimm4/keto_diet/fkfop9y/  Basically on a good diet you shouldn't need the supplements. But on a low carb diet you've to give up so many plant foods and you also give up so many unique nutrients.

"Thanks, your comments were super helpful. I have been off keto for probably about 4 months now and the hair loss only worsened. I did see my doctor again today and he genuinely impressed me- he knew of no link before between PCOS and hair loss and after I mentioned that I saw it on the NHS website he read up on it during my appointment and said I was right. He’s referring me to a dermatologist to help with the hair loss for now and told me that I should be good to do keto as it likely won’t affect things at all- since the problem is most likely the high androgens, just might make it better along with weight loss.  Since you mentioned your experience I’ll keep it in mind and try not to freak out if I see a bit more hair loss when I start dropping weight haha. I’ll just stick it out and hopefully it’ll get better like yours did.  I’ll check out the link for the biotin- i took it before as part of a nail hair vitamin and also it was part of my normal a-z vitamins so I got it from like 2 sources but I wouldn’t be surprised if it wasn’t enough or something..

"I've found a nice article (thank you u/ramesesbolton) on PCOS written by someone who agrees with your dietary theories:  [http://www.tuitnutrition.com/2019/06/pcos.html?m=1](http://www.tuitnutrition.com/2019/06/pcos.html?m=1)  &gt;It’s also noteworthy that the weight loss and lower insulin levels in this study were achieved without changes to subjects’ usual exercise habits, and without them specifically being told to cut back on calories—or to count calories at all. You know what that means? It means that the dietary change alone was effective. **No “eat less, move more.” Just a low carb diet. Period.**  Her diet/lifestyle advice is to restrict carbs, eat animal foods and fat and don't even attempt to lose weight or exercise more.  &gt;As an adjunct to carbohydrate restriction, certain supplements might be helpful for aiding with insulin sensitivity and blood glucose management. Two that come to mind are chromium and berberine. For PCOS, specifically, inositol appears to be a biggie, in the forms myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI). These compounds have an impressive record of efficacy for reducing fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, total and free testosterone, and for restoring normal ovulation and menstrual cycles (sources: 1, 2, 3).  In a randomized trial in women with PCOS, 6 months of treatment with myo-inositol (4g/day) was shown to have similar effects as metformin (1500mg/day) for improving insulin sensitivity and restoring the menstrual cycle.  A systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of inositols as therapy for PCOS concluded that myo- and D-chiro-inositol have “a pivotal role […] as a safe and effective therapy for PCOS. Combined with inositol, alpha-lipoic acid is another compound that might be helpful to supplement with for PCOS, mainly owing to beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. (See here and here.)  She recommends metformin, myo-inositol and alpha-lipoic acid. Metformin is a synthetic variant of a [plant extract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin#History). Inositol is directly found in the plants that are high in [phytic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol#Phytic_acid_in_plants) such as beans and legumes. Finally alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is the omega3 found in all veggies. But wait a moment, according to many low carb **quacks** plant foods are toxic, phytic acid is a serious poison and ALA is inferior to DHA/EPA! Don't you see the futility and the stupidity of this?  She reviewed a good amount of literature on PCOS and she didn't come up with any conclusion of practical significance. What she is selling to women is **a trick to lower insulin while remaining obese**.   Will lower insulin at least help the women with PCOS? We don't know because she **doesn't** come up with any convincing argument to show that lowering insulin is **really** so important for this disease. Probably only the obesity-induced PCOS can be **managed** by this trick.",/r/PCOS/comments/fhimm4/keto_diet/fkfop9y/,comment,2020-03-13 16:39:05-06:00

"I'd say I noticed it around when I hit the -20lbs mark and it continued for 3 or 4 weeks maybe (that was over 4 years ago now so I can't remember exactly how long, I'm sorry!). I wasn't keto then though, just eating healthier and working out. It was that classic ""male pattern"" baldness but while my hair did get upsettingly thin I didn't have any bald patches. Then once I got on keto (three years ago) I had another spike in hair loss but it wasn't as much as the first time and hasn't happened since from weight loss.   However, I decided to listen to a well-meaning doctor who told me to go off keto to help with some stomach issues around August last year (it didn't help, I just got really sick from my insulin going nuts again) and *that* was a really scary amount of hair loss. Being off keto messed with my hormones *hard* which was why the hair loss and all my other nasty PCOS symptoms happened so if your body is still regulating that could be part of it.   I ain't even done yet but I've lost a total of 65 pounds at this point and the closest I got to going bald was when I went off keto for 2-2.5 months so unless you have an underlying condition you should be fine!

I have trouble staying under 120g and making my calories for the day(I’m not trying to lose any more weight). In sept I was at 150g of carbs a day + 1500mg of metformin and I actually got a period on my own and even ovulated. I keep track of my glucose and what I eat for dinner I think is def affecting my reading. I think I’m just over it I feel like I’ve been working so hard last 7 months and for what? I do so good with my carbs then I make one bad decision and mess up for the day so that’s why I was asking like is it bad if for 2 meals I eat great then one meal I eat something that causes a spike. I def need to speak to a endocrinologist.,/r/PCOS/comments/fi3xk1/how_does_glucose_work_throughout_the_day_and_how/fkffqgc/,comment,2020-03-13 15:03:21-06:00

"it's not your glucose that affects your period, it's insulin. insulin is the hormone that shuttles the fuel from the carbs you eat (that's glucose) into your cells. it's also the hormone that-- if your levels are too high-- causes your ovaries to release too much testosterone and prevents ovulation, which in turn stalls your cycle.   every time you eat a carb your body has to release insulin in order to move that energy into your cells for fuel. if you have insulin *resistance* your cells are hesitant to accept that energy from the insulin. in response your body releases more and more insulin in order to force the glucose into your cells. this leads to the chain reaction of PCOS I described in the first paragraph. eventually your pancreas is no longer able to produce the high levels of insulin required to fuel insulin-resistant cells, and this is when type two diabetes develops.  if your glucose is high in the mornings this is a sign that your body's insulin response isn't able to fuel your cells correctly. by reducing your intake of carbohydrates you reduce your body's reliance on insulin and give it fuel from other sources.   from my personal experience, I didn't get my period at all when my carb intake was 100g+. my blood glucose was up and down but I had pretty persistent hyperinsulinemia. reducing my carbs brought it back like clockwork and also eliminated my other PCOS symptoms.",/r/PCOS/comments/fi3xk1/how_does_glucose_work_throughout_the_day_and_how/fkf5v4c/,comment,2020-03-13 13:27:52-06:00

"Hello! Fertility nurse with PCOS here (been diagnosed since I was 15). PCOS typically involves the ovary being unable to form a dominant follicle (hence why the ovulatory phase is so so long with so many little follicles [lots of cysts] leading to long cycles). We see a lot of patients with PCOS and there are medications that help your ovary form dominant follicles to allow you to ovulate. For same sex couples we will always start with donor insemination. If not successful, IVF can also be considered. Both processes will cost money but will not be as expensive as adoption.   TLDR rest assured there are treatments available for PCOS!!

"Good luck OP! I know how exhausting it can be having to shave all the time.

It's a new world and it's more accepting than it used to be.   Side note and this is obviously information you didn't ask for, but if it is a struggle, maybe laser or electrolysis might be something to consider.

Sihk women do not remove any hair from their bodies and basically from what I know from all my friends (I have pcos as well but only have hair on my chest) is you can apply oil to it like castor oil or mustard seed oil to keep it kept up. I honestly think my friends are so beautiful with the excess hair. Having to shave everyday should stay just a preference and not a standard or have to.

"I've edited message above and added some remarks here and there. Diets centered around animal foods and fat are poisonous. The resulting health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and PCOS, are well-known examples of food poisoning.   When obese people are poisoned more intensely they lose appetite, they reduce their food intake and they're **temporarily** cured from the problems associated with obesity. This is used by charlatans and food industry as an excuse to promote the unhealthy foods that have caused the problem to begin with.

"Good for you for making a change! It can be overwhelming to do it at first, but I really do think it makes a difference! Many products are chock full of chemicals that are hormone disrupting. I went down a rabbit hole of googling all of it a few years back and made a lot of changes in just about every aspect of my life.   I only use unscented, diluted (~1:4 soap to water ratio) Castile soap. I use that for hand washing soap (with a foaming pump), for my face wash, and as body wash for the shower (all using the foaming pump). I've used the Dr. Bronner's brand and a store brand of it. You want to avoid parabens, phthalates, sulfates, alcohol if you can, and a few others I'm not recalling right now. I usually look for the shortest ingredient list and stick to plant based ingredients.  Another brand I like to use is Shea Moisture for shampoo, conditioner, and lotion - not all of their products are 100% free of alcohols, so check the label, but I've had the best luck with them. I use Schmidts natural deodorant and it works well for me - you still sweat, but don't stink. I want to eat the Bergamot Lime one it smells so good haha.   I'm not normally a fan of mlm companies and I may get hated on for suggesting it, but I've switched to using Norwex products for all cleaning in my house. They are just microfiber cloths that you get wet with water and are supposed to disinfect surfaces. They've worked really well for me. I know other people have used just vinegar and water sprays to clean, but I can't handle the smell of vinegar. I use a Shark steamer mop for my kitchen and hardfloors - it only uses tap water to clean, no chemicals added.   For laundry, I use a plant based, no additives laundry detergent. I forget what it's called, but I buy it in a huge container from Sam's Club and it has some lavender essential oils in it. I usually skip softener, but ended up needing to use it over winter - I settled with the unscented Seventh Generation brand of it. For the dryer, I use wool dryer balls instead of dryer sheets. I just buy those on Amazon - just make sure they are 100% wool. For dish soap, I use the unscented Seventh Generation brand.   Sorry if this was too much information!

"&gt;This is where your vegan bias is harming people on this sub -- the fact is  clinical trials have, in fact, showed benefit from a ketogenic diet for PCOS. And fasting, too.  I'm not harming people in this sub, you're because you confuse the science with the pseudoscience. You make it sound as if there is some science showing low carb diet is good for PCOS when there is not. There is some **pseudoscience** funded by Atkins and meat and dairy industry showing that you can **poison** obese people and improve their PCOS. **This pseudoscience has no control groups so we can't know if the benefits are due to weight loss or due to food poisoning.** We've plenty of science on weight loss and on long term disease incidence, including PCOS. Losing weight is very health promoting. Eating well prevents diseases and in many cases it eventually cures them.  &gt;Fasting being a form of CHO restriction that evokes ketosis, of course.  Fasting is food restriction. Yes, healthy foods have carbs so fasting for healthy people also involves carb restriction.  &gt;This is dishonest when every link you post is to a vegan, plant ONLY, NO  animal products EVER sub or website!  It's right there first thing on  the right when you go to the ""plant based"" sub -- NO animal products,  which means plant ONLY.  Only an idiot would expect me to agree with every source I cite. Are you an idiot or you're dishonest? Or maybe you're both? :)  &gt;Fat, alone, causes no insulin response. Fat and refined grains like  wheat cause insulin resistance and high BG -- so don't eat the refined  carbs!  Fat alone causes a tiny but prolonged insulin response. Fat causes insulin resistance and **refined grains cure insulin resistance**. Once you've insulin resistant, if you don't want to cure yourself by eating properly, then you have to restrict carb intake to keep insulin in check.  &gt;Basically either extreme, very very low-fat AND excluding ALL animal products (vegan, your diet) or very low CHO with ample low-net-carb veggies and fish, meat, eggs, whole milk dairy and so on.  Both diets would include olives and nuts.    Why 5% fat diet is ""very very low fat"" and 5% carb is only ""very low carb""? Why there is this asymmetry here? Because you're just a charlatan.  Extreme is relative, I've already explained, for me 5% fat is not extreme. For you it is extreme because you eat 70% fat. You're the problem.  You don't have to be extreme if you eat properly and you're healthy. If you've PCOS or another condition related to insulin then you may want to do the very low fat diets to minimize symptoms. The very low fat diets do not include any olives and nuts. I don't do these diets. I do not recommend these diets unless I think they're needed for the person.  Regarding animal foods, they cause various problems, and again, it depends on the situation. If your problem is triggered by animal foods then you've to be more restrictive. In the case of PCOS I think the problem is also triggered by animal foods. Insulin and insulin resistance are also triggered by animal foods and that's another thing to consider.  &gt;However the clinical trials with positive benefit are for keto and PCOS.  These trials show t hat poisoning people causes weight loss and then weight loss causes improvements in PCOS biomarkers.",/r/PCOS/comments/fhimm4/keto_diet/fkebhye/,comment,2020-03-13 08:27:27-06:00
"Keep in mind the push for veganism and vegetarianism in the early part of the 1900s was largely religious (7th Day Adventists) and that Kellogg was an anti-sex guy who thought boring food would reduce people's interest in sex.

"Specifically iron , zinc and vitamin D are quite important for hair health and growth . Full blood work /blood count doesn’t really include these so you might have to ask your GP for these test separately. (At least that’s how it is in Australia ) For iron make sure you ask for iron studies ,including ferritin . Also one thing I would say is always ask your GP to give you a print of your test for your own filing at home , that way you can keep track and see any changes , especially when you’re trying out different supplement or change your diet .  Also if you’re taking a multivitamin or hair supplement, that  might not address a deficiency unfortunately .  I would say if your hair shedding continues , go back to your GP and demand additional testing . They usually are quite dismissive of hair loss because they don’t seem it important , even tho it causes such an psychological distress ..  Is your shedding all over or in specific areas . That sometimes point you in direction if it’s either a deficiency or caused by high androgens . Another thing is autoimmune issues , do you have any ? How are you other hormones - progesterone , estrogen and testosterone ? Are they in normal ranges ? Investigate because it might be the keto , but it might not . Usually it takes for hair loss to come up 3 months after an “event” such as diet change , or a stressful period for example .   If you really think keto is the issue , search for hair loss in some of the keto groups , I’m pretty sure I’ve seen some posts about it . From what I’ve seen , it’s temporary and it stops in couple of months .   Sorry I’m all over the place , but hair loss can be caused by literally anything .

It's reasonably close to whole foods diets but it's not because oils are allowed.  &gt; Keto has some clinical trials showing improvement of PCOS.   All weight loss diets improve PCOS. There is no evidence that the most extreme low carb diets that you advocate are any better, especially in the long term.  &gt;Keto is less extreme than the plant ONLY diet you recommend, where someone has to exclude ALL animal products and almost all fat as it is a very very low fat diet in addition.   I don't recommend plant ONLY diets, i recommend plant BASED diets. Regarding fat intake it depends on the situation. If your goal is minimal insulin then you've to minimize fat intake too. It's not my fault if the human body works in this way.  &gt; The main benefit to the plant ONLY diet is it's based on whole foods, and that's a good thing.  There is no criterion for selecting one benefit as the ""main"" one. For most people the restriction of animal foods is the main benefit. For others it's restriction of fat.  &gt;Keto includes low-net-carb veggies and, while you repeatedly intentionally misunderstand this, low-net-carb fruits such as berries, in small amounts. I'll sometimes consume more than a small amount when exercising because they are great on hikes.  I've never said that it can't include some fruits and veggies.

"Pcos is not an illness it is a syndrome kinda like Down or Autism. Basically we are born with it.    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987707004811  Basically PCOS stems from hyperandrogenism in utero. So your mother's hormones were not in the right balance meaning you as a fetus were not able to make the right hormonal balance. Tgis is also why its inheritable, women with PCOS have a higher chance of having a daughter with PCOS because of hyperandrogenism caused by PCOS.  There is also something of a cure. But that won't help us.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521690X18300514  By giving pregnant women special hormones to balance out their hormones durian pregnancy. You can create the correct environment so the female fetus grows with the right hormone balance and thus less chance of PCOS.  Notting we eat will be make PCOS go away.

I was pretty much secure in the fact I wasn't going to have kids at 17. After the doctor at 19 told me I also have a severely misshapen uterus as well, adding to my issue of infertility, I had a lot of soul searching and my BF dumped me after learning I couldn't have kids.

"No, this is normal. Over time the pill can cause lighter periods or no period. It’s frequently prescribed to women to help manage heavy or painful periods for this reason.    If it helps, it’s also not a real period. Technically on birth control, it’s a withdrawal bleed that your body (sometimes) gets because of the drop in hormones. You don’t ovulate on the pill, so it’s not a “true” period. There’s no real reason to have a break week except that many women find it’s comforting to bleed on a schedule because it’s “normal”. I skipped my period constantly on purpose by taking packs back to back (prescribed for PCOS).   Some methods of bc are more likely to have this side effect of no withdrawal bleed, including the depo shot but the pill can definitely cause this and it’s not an issue.

"That sounds ridiculous. I don't know why, but some doctors are hesitant to make a diagnosis when it seems plain as day and treatment could only help your symptoms.  About 10 years ago, when I was first diagnosed, two doctors (I switched doctors shortly after initial diagnosis) agreed I absolutely had PCOS. I had most of the classic symptoms, positive blood work and ultrasound, and a family history. My symptoms greatly improved when I started a high dose birth control pill and saw a dietician about following a low GI diet.  However, I moved a few times since and have had two doctors give me a hard time about the diagnosis and pill dosage I take because my symptoms didn't seem as obvious to them. I wanted to scream, ""DUH. Cuz I'm on the pill for treatment and lost weight and shave and pluck like crazy. Take me off the pill and watch what happens.""  So, in short, I hope you can find a more supportive doctor who is more knowledgeable of the condition. Some doctors just suck.",/r/PCOS/comments/fhe3p1/2_years_after_my_diagnosis_of_pcos_i_got_told/fkd89ef/,comment,2020-03-12 21:42:18-06:00

"I’m sensitive to a lot of added proteins/fibers (like whey protein and inulin/chicory fiber), so I often eat a late afternoon snack from a combo of these foods:  —a couple tablespoons of peanut or almond butter on 2-3 brown rice cakes (I like the ones called “thin stackers”) —a small apple or half a medium/large apple —hard-boiled egg —cheddar cheese —celery, carrots —couple of Brazil nuts —a couple of Gluten Free Bar (GFB) Bites  or a mini GFB bar or *half or a mini* clif bar —jerky (they do make salmon jerky!

"I have had so much trouble with my weight. I'm 5'2 and have been doing low carb for about 15 years now, I had great success at first, but I have gone through some yo-yos. Staying low carb is hard, generally. I tried metformin for a bit but didn't really feel like I felt any difference than if I were taking my diet serious, and so I went back to an intermittent fasting protocol. Currently I am doing OMAD (one meal a day, being mindful of calorie goals and macros) focusing still on mostly low carb options but give myself a little leeway and what tends to happen most days is I am fasting until about 4pm, weekends I go easier and eat what I want, no holds barred. I lost about 25 lbs (took about 6 months) and got back into my goal weight range, which for me is about 140. I'm feeling pretty good, the fasting is hard (Mondays especially) but once I get about a day or two into the week it gets easier, I fall into a pretty good routine. Maybe not for everyone all the time, but it's what is working for me, right now. I generally find fasting a good tool, but thats all it is. A means to an end.  I also work out for an hour twice a week, (weight training/isometrics) and stay fairly active during the day, walking everywhere.",/r/PCOS/comments/fhbh2z/upset_about_weight_gain/fkd6c6n/,comment,2020-03-12 21:18:17-06:00

"I know how you feel. In July 2016 I went to the OB/GYN for a check up and to ask about my options to get pregnant.  I was always told I would never get pregnant naturally. Well she did an ultrasound and it showed a mass on my left ovary.  Damn, not the news I wanted to hear. I went to a specialist and a surgeon and I had to have surgery about 2 weeks later. It was the size of a full watermelon.  It was 16 inches long and had 2 liters of fluid in it. And the surgery took longer than it was supposed to so that was nerve wracking. The ended up taking the tumor out along with my left ovary and my fallopian tube, and left me with a nice long scar on my stomach.  It was hard to go through. Not so much the physical part but it really did effect me emotionally. But I guess it worked out in the end because it wasn't cancerous and 4 months later I was pregnant with my son, even though they said it would never happen. So just know in the future if you want more children, its definitely possible with only one ovary and PCOS and that it takes time to recover emotionally,  but just take time for yourself, take bath, paint your nails, do your hair because once that precious little baby comes none of it even matters anymore.  At least that's how I felt. Best of luck to you!!",/r/PCOS/comments/fhplkz/i_lost_an_ovary_due_to_pcos/fkd5mtn/,comment,2020-03-12 21:09:44-06:00

"When i was diagnosed with pcos I didn’t have any other symptoms besides irregular periods and the doctor said it was extremely odd. No hair, no dark patches, not severely over weight?(though they still encouraged to try half my weight). They stretched from 2 weeks to eventually 2 months and got extremely expensive because of the amount of blood i was losing along with the painfully large clots i was experiencing. It took over 3 months to get my diagnosis because my mental health had been prioritised so it eclipsed the session completely and was delayed in discussion until i my current health had improved. I do feel like i was being mucked around when it came to the blood test and the ultrasounds but im thankful i was able to be told what I had.

"My case is similar to yours, I have some of the symptoms but not all. I've been to 6 different doctors (2 endocrinologists, 2 obgyns, 2 general doctors), and none of them had the exact same opinion.    Here's what I gathered: PCOS is a ""trendy"" thing to diagnose nowadays, and there is actually no 100% consensus among doctors about how to tell if someone has it for sure. It's actually very common to not have all the symptoms, but it's also very vague to just say ""you're supposed to have irregular periods and body hair and etc.""     There are 3 things to do about PCOS: 1) take regular medicine, which disrupts your body's balance, so it should be only used if you're sure you have PCOS 2) take supplements and vitamins that help 3) change your eating and sports habits. You see, 2 of these are things you can do without any potential harm, and 1 of these can be quite risky.     I have decided to not take regular medication. My symptoms, thank God, are not so bad that I wanna take medication for it. But changing my diet has been an amazing thing and I love it, I feel so much lighter and healthier and better.     BUT! Regardless of all this, if I can ask this of you, PLEASE tell your next doctor your previous conditions. He couldn't have guessed that you're on birth control and that it's masking your symptoms. Maybe even after he learns this, he will be of the same opinion, but he SHOULD be aware of these things.    p. s. my symptoms are a few new hairs on my face next to my ears, insulin resistance, pain in the ovaries. I've never had acne, my periods have become regular (they used to be a bit longer, like 35-45 days, tho), I'm hairy but not in a manly way, and no dark patches.",/r/PCOS/comments/fhe3p1/2_years_after_my_diagnosis_of_pcos_i_got_told/fkca6wa/,comment,2020-03-12 15:34:21-06:00

That Dr has clearly confused himself, the diagnostic criteria usually state that the fat centres around the belly. PCOS patients often have a pot belly, that's where the fat is stored. Clearly you do, since you have high testosterone. There's actually papers suggesting Asians might be underdiagnosed because hirsutism looks different for an Asian. However, I have a joke and I hope this cheers you up: How do you cure PCOS? laser hair removal and accutane!  The joke being that doctors neglect symptoms that patients have cured themselves.

"I would get a second opinion. I had PCOS and was diagnosed when I had an almost underweight BMI but I still had hair loss, acne, insulin resistance, and cysts on my ovaries.   My understanding is there are only three criteria for PCOS and to be diagnosed you need to meet one of them: irregular periods, cysts on ovaries, and/or hormone levels indicative of PCOS. To be absolutely certain, you could get an internal ultrasound and make sure that you have the actual cysts. If you don’t though, it would be good to make sure you don’t have something else going on!.",/r/PCOS/comments/fhe3p1/2_years_after_my_diagnosis_of_pcos_i_got_told/fkbg57l/,comment,2020-03-12 10:59:40-06:00

"I was on an antidepressant many years ago for anxiety, and it made it super easy for me to gain 20 lbs. My best friend took up running as a hobby so I felt encouraged to join a run club. I’m not a huge fan of cardio (still am not to this day), but I actually looked forward to meeting my new friends twice a week to go on runs and to train for races (I had a goal of finishing a half-marathon). The weight slowly melted off when I also started tracking what I was eating and how much. When I was able to wean off of the antidepressant eventually (therapy helped a lot), it really helped me lose the last stubborn lbs.

Also, I think the arm implant is a progesterone only BC which can really make PCOS worse for some women. It may be worth considering trying combined BC instead or something else altogether.",/r/PCOS/comments/fhe3p1/2_years_after_my_diagnosis_of_pcos_i_got_told/fkantr9/,comment,2020-03-12 06:04:53-06:00
"This doctor sounds inept to treat PCOS. PCOS is 100% not just the classic presentation which it sounds like he is ignorant to. I am lean with a BMI of 21 but I have string of pearls follicles on ultrasound, high adrenal androgens (DHEA-S), and periods once every six months (well not right now because I’m 30 weeks pregnant thanks to a doctor who treats PCOS well). That satisfies all the necessary criteria for diagnosing PCOS and your doctor seems to be ignoring all the real criteria. We now know that PCOS can look very different for every woman because there are various potential root causes.

"In my early 20s I went to multiple doctors who went back and forth on PCOS.  I think a lot of times why they said I didn’t have it was because I was never that overweight.  I remember I went to one endocrinologist and I spoke with the PA and I was trying to get answers. She told me everything was fine and I asked if she was sure because I felt like maybe something was wrong. She then said, “do you want there to be something wrong with you?”  It was awful. I said well I really would like to know why I haven’t had a period on my own for 8 months. Then she did some back pedaling and it was clear she hadn’t read my chart. Made me come back a second time and I met with the endocrinologist who acted like I was wasting her time and told me, “of course you have PCOS” like I was a dumbass.   I’m now in my 30s and I’ve pretty much given up on medical intervention.  After that visit with that endocrinologist I was like fine I have PCOS and I’m on my own. For me I tried multiple birth control pills but it makes me crazy.  I find that if I can keep my weight down I do better. Spearmint tea also is a big help and I also feel like as I hit my mid 30s my hormones have leveled out some.   I’m sorry you’re going through this. There are a lot of good doctors out there but there are also a lot of bad ones.

"What do you mean when you say you can’t get exercise down? You can’t seem to stick to it? Also I know your weight gain is due to medication, so I don’t know if this will help, but Berberine saves my ass when I felt stuck. I was working my ass off to minimal results until I went on that stuff. It’s a supplement for blood sugar regulation, but like I said, I’m not sure if it will help given that your weight gain is from medication. However, if you’re insulin resistant (as most of us with PCOS are), it could still help you.  As for exercise, I joined planet fitness and picked 3 or 4 days to go workout. I’ve tried a variety of things there so it never really gets old. Then one or two other days I do yoga at home. I had to tell myself it wasn’t for losing weight. That I was doing it to get stronger or more flexible or for heart health. If I made weight loss my goal, I felt I had such a long road ahead.

Sounds like a rough time. But it’s amazing you’re wanting to keep looking after yourself. A walk first thing in the morning for 45min everyday is such a good way to lose weight and start your day off well - being outside helps you feel good :) I like to do Pilates at home using YouTube to tone up as well when I have time.

"I personally am Vegetarian and have been for 2 years. I started off vegan for about a year, and ive introduced some eggs and salmon into my diet for healthy fats and proteins. I personally don't see anything wrong with a vegan/vegetarian diet even though it is a bit higher carb. As long as the carbs are complex they are less likely to cause a spike in insulin levels. Even the keto diet can end up being poor for PCOS depending on what you eat. For instance, I've seen people on keto who eat nothing but cheese, butter, oils, and processed meats to get into ketosis. That's doing just as much damage to your body as eating high carb. My point in saying all of this is that everyone's body is different, listen to your body and do what feels right. Stressing too much about what you're eating is only going to raise cortisol levels and make your hormones worse any ways, so just take it all one day at a time and just do your best to eat well and take care of yourself.

"The first 4.5 minutes of this video are great, filled with accurate information that people need to know.  After that things go a bit sideways.  So... he's not wrong in that liver cells being filled with fat is a significant contributor to lowered SHBG and thus higher testosterone.  There is good evidence though that a low carbohydrate diet is the simplest dietary method of emptying this fat, which is why low carb diets are prescribed for non-alcoholic fatty liver.  The claim that protein can cause an increase in glucose is kind of misunderstood, since that only happens via gluconeogenesis produced from your liver when your body believes you need extra glucose.  Protein doesn't contribute in any significant way to hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia.  He also makes a direct connection to fat in cells from fat you have consumed.  This is not accurate and this is not how it generally works.  Fat can only enter into cells when insulin is high enough to push it in -- this is why T1 diabetics lose a ton of weight during DKA prior to diagnosis despite generally attempting to eat themselves out of house and home -- they have no or very low levels of insulin.  It is *not* generally true that eating calories from fat will make you fat.  This is a huge misunderstanding that is only getting real scientific attention again as of the last 5-10 years.    As a T2 diabetic who started out with an a1c of 10 and has controlled it down to 5.0 with low carb, I use a CGM and I can say that a low carbohydrate diet clearly works for reducing hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.  You also lose weight as a side-effect of low carbohydrate diets, and much of that weight comes from the reduction of visceral fat which causes metabolic syndrome.  Being a vegan is not totally incompatible with low carbohydrate, but it is certainly much more difficult.  There is certainly benefit in being vegan over eating the standard American food pyramid diet; mostly in that you eat significantly less processed foods since most processed foods are non-vegan. Those processed foods tend to be a major source of empty carbohydrates (and empty calories in general).  If you lose weight because of reduced calories on a vegan diet, that will help your PCOS, but there are lots of ways to lose weight, and it's also possible to eat a vegan diet and not lose weight if you inch more toward empty snacking over healthy nutrient-rich food.",/r/PCOS/comments/fh57nr/opinion_on_this_video_claiming_veganism_is_better/fk94oip/,comment,2020-03-11 17:17:25-06:00

"&gt;You do make a good point however I don't think rameses is wrong - just oversimplifying/missing a part of the picture.  Well, she has got something right but she is overstating.  &gt;The current thinking is that PCOS in most cases is caused by a problem with insulin resistance.   It seems women with PCOS have other differences that, when combined with insulin resistance, and when combined with high carb foods, trigger the symptoms. Removing the high carb foods, or removing the insulin resistance, doesn't make them ""fully normal"". However it does help and maybe it's ""good enough"".  &gt;Why do some people have IR and some not have IR? What makes some people able to eat a ton of carbs without any ill effects and not others? I'm personally very interested in this question and I believe there will be potentially many factors that could fed into IR depending on the individual. However some/many of those underlying factors may not be easily treatable, so we may still be stuck with the insulin reducing/sensitising treatments we have now (low carb/keto diet, metformin, exercise).  This topic I've studied in depth. There are genetic differences and the people with PCOS may have these genetic differences that make them more insulin resistant when everything else is OK. There is excess body weight and sedentary lifestyles.   Finally there is diet, diets that are low in carbs and high in fat and animal foods **cause** insulin resistance. The more **extreme** variants of these diets will make the insulin resistance (**almost**) asymptomatic because you're no longer eating carbs.  Basically the empirical question is this: do women with PCOS have such intractable insulin resistance that, even when put on diets that do normally cure insulin resistance, they still get unsatisfactory results? If answer is yes then keto is the proper care. If the answer is no then the exact opposite is the proper care. I would bet my money on the latter option but maybe there is room for individual differences. Maybe different kinds of PCOS require different diets.",/r/PCOS/comments/fh2arj/testosterone_blockers/fk90sh0/,comment,2020-03-11 16:41:00-06:00

"You do make a good point however I don't think rameses is wrong - just oversimplifying/missing a part of the picture.  The current thinking is that PCOS in most cases is caused by a problem with insulin resistance. But what causes the problem with insulin resistance in the first place? Why do some people have IR and some not have IR? What makes some people able to eat a ton of carbs without any ill effects and not others? I'm personally very interested in this question and I believe there will be potentially many factors that could fed into IR depending on the individual. However some/many of those underlying factors may not be easily treatable, so we may still be stuck with the insulin reducing/sensitising treatments we have now (low carb/keto diet, metformin, exercise).",/r/PCOS/comments/fh2arj/testosterone_blockers/fk8yg62/,comment,2020-03-11 16:20:19-06:00

"The standard keto diet -- fatty meats, whole milk dairy and low-net-carb veggies like the leafy greens and broccoli/cauliflower.  While meat does cause a rise in insulin, it also causes glucagon release and overall meat/protein consumption does not seem correlated with PCOS.  Beans, lentils and nuts are good low-carb foods as long as you don't eat too much.  If you aren't aiming for ketosis (&lt; 50g NET carbs/day) then you can fit in more beans and lentils.  Quinoa is good because it's also high protein.  But consume those foods with fat -- both to absorb vitamins and also to slow digestion and the flow of glucose into the blood.

"&gt; This is wrong. There is evidence from clinical trials that PCOS improves on a whole foods ketogenic diet. You don't like that fact but the facts don't change just from you throwing a tantrum.  You refer to studies where people are poisoned with these diets? These studies usually have no control group, and when they've control groups, they eat garbage diets. Nor these studies last anywhere near the time needed to make a call.  On the other hand epidemiological data is very clear on PCOS (and on obesity). These problems are caused by low carb diets and are cured by high carb diets. You're the one throwing tantrums just because your fad diet is exposed for what it really is.  Carbohydrate is a very essential macro if you want to be healthy. If you want to be a cognitively impaired zombie with no appetite then yes they're not essential.  Here is the latest study on food poisoning for weight loss: https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/fh155n/michael_eades_md_one_of_the_vampire_myths_that/  In 3 months, ~28% of the weight loss is due to losses of **lean mass**. They've not significantly increased protein intake (they're close the typical values observed in western societies) and yet they claim that protein doesn't cause kidney damage!  Meat is a vague term and this is why I don't use it. Flesh is more precise. Flesh is unhealthy for the general population. Flesh is also relatively nutrient poor compared to other whole foods (it has many calories for little nutrients).  Sugar isn't food. Grains are the real superfood and they're more nutrient dense than flesh: https://nutritionalrevolution.org/2019/12/25/grains-are-more-nutritious-than-meat/",/r/PCOS/comments/fgotb5/sugar_detox/fk8vw26/,comment,2020-03-11 15:58:16-06:00

There is zero evidence ketogenic or low carb diets are better **for long term health of PCOS patients** than calorie restricted junk food diets. There is plenty of evidence vegans and low animal food diets prevent and manage the problem. Why do you think vegans have much lower incidence of obesity and PCOS?  ADA makes money on diabetes and they've always promoted the diets that **seem** to help but actually **cause** the problem. The RDA is a made up number but it's better than the illogical garbage we hear on social media.  There is necessity to consume a lot of carbs if you want to be healthy. Your cognitive impairment is on display almost every time you post something. You can't see it precisely because you've it. Eat more fruits and you'll see it.

"Not to toot the keto horn, but I've been on it for 3 months and it's done wonders for me! Not only have I lost about 30lbs, but the energy levels have just simply amazed me. There is no crashing from low energy in the morning or afternoon. You just... Remain at a constant all day. Sleeping had been easier, waking up is EASY, and you have the energy to do things you would normally dismiss. I've never been a coffee drinker, but from my baking and cooking substitutions, I would say that monk fruit/erythritol is the way to go. You can usually only find it online (lakanto) unless you're in a fancy organic store (more expensive than online), but it's the closest thing I've found to sugar. My bf, when he was keto, used the monk fruit as well as butter in his coffee 😁 and said it was the best coffee he's ever had.",/r/PCOS/comments/fgzf67/sugar_substitutes_and_cutting_out_sugar/fk85olj/,comment,2020-03-11 12:03:55-06:00

"Hi there! From what I have read, stevia is generally considered safe because is a ""natural"" sweetener and comes from the stevia plant leaf and is not a completely man-made substance like artificial sweeteners can be. A little goes a long way so be prepared to use a lot less than you would real sugar. If you use too much it can have an aftertaste and be way too sweet, but if you get the ratio just right you wont be able to tell the difference.  One thing to note, regardless of the type, any sugar substitute will interrupt fasting as your body will produce insulin whenever you taste anything sweet, but this isn't an issue if you are not practicing intermittent fasting. Some places online say that stevia does not do this, but that is incorrect according to Dr. Jason Fung's Obesity Code book. Stevia does not effect your blood glucose levels but you will still have an insulin response and stop fat burning if you are in a fasted state. Black coffee will not do this, but I'm with ya on the disgusting part.  The difference from cutting out refined sugar is pretty huge. Generally less belly bloat, less body aches due to inflammation, less crashes from up and down blood sugar and less brain fog for most people.",/r/PCOS/comments/fgzf67/sugar_substitutes_and_cutting_out_sugar/fk7v8kh/,comment,2020-03-11 10:30:57-06:00

Third month on berberine.

It really sucks the waiting to get pregnant when PCOS makes it harder.  I did skip a cycle when I was trying to conceive which was promoted me to go to an obgyn and found out I had PCOS.  (I had light bleeding for a few weeks which was just the lining falling off cause the blood supply couldn't maintain it all but hadn't had the hormone signal to go through an actual period).  I tested so many times just hoping to get pregnant.

"Those studies that show that also don't take into effect the power of restriction. Look up Christy Harrison's podcast. She talks all about this. Yes, having PCOS &amp; insulin resistance does make us more prone to sugar cravings, but you can feel that, listen to it, respect what your body is doing, and then choose something else like a protein/carb mix like an apple with peanut butter. Intuitive eating &amp; permission to eat does not mean go all out. It means listen to your body, tell it you understand what's going on, then make a better choice for yourself. You are not a slave to your body or mind or cravings. You are more like a parent or caretaker to your body and withholding something by demonizing it never works. You will do more harm bingeing and restricting in the long run and cause more inflammation and hormonal imbalances.",/r/PCOS/comments/fgotb5/sugar_detox/fk7dhht/,comment,2020-03-11 07:41:31-06:00

"I have worked in several medical settings. Even though the doctor wasn’t rude, she seems like an extremely poor communicator. Doctors need to help staff know that there are orders, ideally they need to let patients know, too. Also, doctors should read charts, but a lot of them prefer to go in to see patients ‘cold’ without reading anything and then record everything into the chart later after they have had time to think about it. That way leads to mistakes in the moment, mixing up details, and missed orders as the staff is dealing with the next 50 patients, not the last 50 patients. Orders in a hospital  are seen by the 24/7 staff, so some doctors *cannot be convinced* that offices run differently.

"So, when I go hard with any exercise, it backfires. I tried P90X and gained 30 lbs of fat doing that, using a post workout supplement, and watching my calories. After that, my weight would continue to climb anytime I worked out. 7 years after I tried the p90x, I got diagnosed with PCOS (that was about 2 years ago now), and after a lot of trial and error, I've finally found something that's at least helping enough for the moment. I take myo inositol/d chiro, and I watch my macros and make sure I'm eating at a deficit, and I weight lift at a light/moderate effort alternating 7 and 20 lbs kettlebells every other day for anywhere between 20-50 minutes, and on my between days I switch between modified weighted squats on my rowing machine, and actually rowing on it for 20-30 minutes. I started that in January and I've hit a loss of 2% body fat and about 6lbs off the scale.

"Ok this is insane because I’m literally having your issue. If you check my page you can see I’ve made some posts about it. This is really leading me to believe I have more going on than just Pcos. A lot of women with Pcos actually build muscle more because of the excess testosterone and can get fit easily. Some struggle with losing weight because of insulin reaistance but that doesn’t really have anything to do with putting in muscle mass. Before my Pcos diagnosis I was able to build muscle really quick with doing low weights like I was able to lean up and look defined. Now my proximal muscles(lower body) DO NOT retain muscle no matter WHAT. I actually would feel really weak sometimes and physically couldn’t exercise. Our issue very well be related to high cortisol and more rarely Cushings disease. What are your other symptoms? I have hair balding, excess hair growth, stretch marks on my tummy but nothing crazy, I’m a natural apple body type so I gain my weight up top.

It's a known fact that sugar is addictive like heroin.  If there is a problem why is experimenting a bad idea?  This is an experiment where I am using many variables.  It is also fact that processed sugar is bad for PCOS.  Why is this so restrictive?  Maybe it could help people experiment and see if it helps and if doesn't they can do whatever they want.  I am doing a new program called naturally slim and helps with metabolic syndrome and preventing diabetes.  They recommend that people quit sugar for 3 weeks.  It is a program where you eat when you are hungry and of possible skip breakfast.  So it is intuitive eating.  This diet is designed for people that work at desks.  There is not one size fits all for diet for the general population.  You have to mix ideas and experiment to see what works.  I hope this makes it clear of what I'm doing.  I'm just seeing if people would want to join a detox and see if it works.  I'm going to try to stick to natural sugars.

"You might want to consider working with a personal trainer you trust. It sounds like you’re really confused about the basics, such as calculating your unique caloric and macro needs for building muscle and the different strategies people use to get there (eg carb cycling, bulking then cutting, etc). This applies to exercise routines too, such as switching it up between heavier weights for smaller reps, lighter weights for more reps, cross-training, etc. You want to be constantly forcing your body to adapt while also building in rest days for recovery, but a trainer can better customize a routine for you to follow.   As for measuring body fat, some gyms have machines that calculate weight, lean body mass, body fat, etc. You can also get calipers or just go by chest, waist, and hip measurements. Personally, without going all out on the above, I knew I made progress when I saw more definition, my clothes fit better, and I could lift/run/move more for longer periods of time despite the scale not budging.

"Some of that isn't addiction, it is a lifetime of restriction. It is like when someone says don't think of the pink elephant and it is all you can think about. Sugar is that way too. Intuitive eating is permission to eat and trusting your body. I was obsessed with ice cream until about 2 years ago when I decided I would let myself eat as much as I want and then did. Now, I only really want it like once every 3 months or so and I get an ice cream cone and then I'm good.   Detoxing is the same as restricting which is the same as dieting which is all opposite of intuitive eating.

"Suggestion: pick up a glucose meter from a drug store and actually measure your blood sugar. If you're below 70 then you're actually hypoglycemic, otherwise you're not.  It's very normal for the body to be a bit out of sorts as you adjust to a lower carbohydrate diet and a lower average glucose, making you feel like you're low even when you're not.  If you're only on metformin, then odds are good that you are not actually hypoglycemic.  All metformin does is stop the liver from releasing excess glucose.  It won't increase your insulin though, which would cause you to become actually hypoglycemic.  We see this behavior very frequently in most new T2 adjusting to low carb.  It goes away after a few weeks of continued low carb eating, as long as they don't continue to feed the problem by re-introducing glucose when they ""feel"" low and are not actually low.  If you introduce glucose unnecessarily then what happens is your sugar rises, and your insulin comes up to meet it, and often times it overshoots how much you actually need (usually because it is delayed due to hyperinsulinemia), and then you end up low again a couple hours later.  The only fix is to stay low carb and don't feed the discomfort.",/r/PCOS/comments/fgdvlw/pcos_and_hypoglycemia/fk5ppq6/,comment,2020-03-10 18:10:43-06:00

"Lean PCOSer here, I got periods once every six months since I started menstruating then “fixed them” with birth control. Eventually got off BC to try and conceive. I spent two years overhauling my diet and lifestyle to help regulate my hormones and cycle which worked... but also worked with a great OBGYN to get bloodwork after I got pregnant and had an early miscarriage. Despite having lost weight fairly easily when I changed my diet my bloodwork revealed I was subclinical hypothyroid on top of meeting all criteria for a PCOS diagnosis— I had the classic string of pearls on my ovaries in ultrasound, high androgens in my bloodwork, and very infrequent periods. The odds were against me for sure. Diet and lifestyle changes supplemented with a small dose of thyroid meds and three rounds of Letrozole at the lowest dose (no ultrasound monitoring, trigger shots, or IVF needed with the med— the tiny, very cheap pills were enough to give me the push my follicles needed) did the trick and today I’m 29w4d pregnant with a very healthy baby girl. Please don’t feel defeated by PCOS! Start getting educated on what’s within your control when it comes to managing your hormones and start there. Interview several OBGYNs and endocrinologists to find one who recognizes and treats PCOS because it’s different for everyone and you need a doctor who will treat YOU, not just the classic presentation of the syndrome.",/r/PCOS/comments/fghoyr/just_got_my_pcos_diagnosis_freaking_out/fk59zsn/,comment,2020-03-10 15:39:20-06:00

I went off the pill a few times and I remember that my periods were painful and I gained weight but I kept a going back on so it didn’t last long.

I wouldn't eat any fries when I went out to eat and I'd give myself half a serving of pasta and extra sauce. stuff like that. I cut down significantly but I was definitely still burning sugar and I continued to get wicked hypo episodes. as soon as I got into ketosis it went away. like overnight.  I've recently been experimenting with adding little bits of carbs back in to see how I tolerate. like a spoonful of brown rice here, or mixing a bit of regular whole wheat flour in with my keto flour and I've tolerated it just fine. no hypo. I think it's just really hard to moderate when you're not keeping track and you naturally start eating way more carbs than you realize. they are digested differently, so they make you feel less full than fat or protein and if you've been in ketosis you're not used to that. if you're having hypo still, though, you're probably not ready to start reintroducing them just yet. the healing/resensitization process takes some time.",/r/PCOS/comments/fgdvlw/pcos_and_hypoglycemia/fk4nabp/,comment,2020-03-10 12:10:06-06:00

"Can you ask your GP to refer you to an endocrinologist? I’ve never had any issue just being direct but respectful about what I want from my doctors. Most of the time, they’re happy to pass me along to a specialist so I don’t keep bothering them about the same issues.   As for building new habits, start small but be consistent. It’s easier to adopt new patterns of behaviour if they work with the flow of your daily life, not against it. For example, I don’t keep any junk food at home, I meal prep for the week so I don’t have to think about what to eat, and I pack my gym clothes with me when I go to work so it’s easy to drop by the gym after work since the gym is along the way home. I even joined fitness groups and made new friends of all body shapes and sizes who identified as fit and active - it’s a lot easier to be healthier if you’re surrounded by positive peer pressure that encourages the behaviours you want to repeat. All of this happened over the course of several years of steady, consistent changes - there was never an overnight “aha!” moment where everything fell into place.

"I’m going to be very real, it sounds like the problems you’re experiencing are a result of the birth control and not PCOS. PCOS can happen “on a scale” in the sense that severity of symptoms caused by the diagnostic criteria can vary heavily from one person to another and the root cause can be different for everyone and for some people there are multiple causes. But in order to be diagnosed PCOS you do need to meet certain criteria like high androgens in your bloodwork, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, and/or consistently missing/infrequent periods. I have lean PCOS, nobody thought I had it based on appearance, but my adrenals (DHEA-S was my high androgen instead of testosterone which is why I never had hirsutism or hair loss) and inflammation were at the root of my PCOS and I met all criteria for diagnosis despite no classic symptoms aside from getting one period every six months.   The only way to REALLY know what your hormones and periods are actually doing is to get off of birth control and see what they’re like off of the pill/IUD which can take a long time to figure out if the BC has really messed with your hormones. Testing your hormones while on BC is basically useless because the BC is manipulating your hormones and masks your true baseline. I would highly recommend going this route, tracking your cycle, and using barrier methods as BC for a while. That is IF you are truly committed to unburying the root cause of your issues.   Also chronic inflammation can play a heavy hand in period problems and weight issues whether or not it’s PCOS. If inflammation is a part of the problem it may not matter how little or how much you’re eating but WHAT you’re eating and how it’s contributing to the hormonal cocktail wreaking havoc in your body. Eliminating top contributors to inflammation from your diet (dairy, sugar, coffee, and alcohol most importantly) along with getting off hormonal birth control for a while to see what your hormonal baseline is when not influenced or manipulated by BC would be a really good start in tackling your issues. Good luck, I hope you get the answers you’re looking for.",/r/PCOS/comments/fgdj1h/endocrinologist_said_pcos_can_be_on_a_scale_and_i/fk48wjs/,comment,2020-03-10 09:55:05-06:00

"Ah! Men having PMS from testosterone turning into estrogen? So that would mean that women with high T, most of it never turns into estrogen for us, right? Is that why we have fertility issues?  I’m wondering if that’s why inositol helps fertility; by lowering T. 🤭 I’ve heard theories on cancer being less prevalent among women who have babies. Apparently this is because of the 9 months where we aren’t exposed to estrogen. Less exposure to estrogen/less cancer risk. So does that also mean we are at a lower risk for certain cancers, because our T prevents normal estrogen levels? If we can regulate the T, are we just as susceptible as a woman who never had high levels?   When you google it, it’s says: “In women, the enzyme aromatase converts some testosterone to estradiol, a type of estrogen. Because HRT has been found to increase breast cancer risk, doctors believe that estradiol converted from testosterone could affect breast cancer risk.”  So, what I gets from that is....we need to lower testosterone somehow. Where it says HRT, I think that refers to hormones trans-women and post-menopause women take to regulate things. So, synthetic hormones seem to protect us from certain cancers, but increase our risk of others? Ugh. This makes me nervous about putting ANYTHING into my body that changes its chemistry. Birth control seems to help my mood, but if it’s putting fake estrogen into me....it seems like a mask for the high t. Cause I’ve been on the pill pretty consistently for 10 years....yet my T is still high. So the synthetic hormones don’t actually affect testosterone, just add estrogen. That’s kind of troublesome to me. :/ this has made me think a lot about how to lower this damn hormone. I want balanced hormones, not masking.  I’mmmmmmm gonna do some research today. Cause antidepressants might help our mood, but that aren’t gonna correct our hormones. Which means BP symptoms will still happen.

"You are a teenager whose brain and body are still growing and developing. You do NOT need to be fasting, which is basically starving yourself. Your body also still needs some carbohydrates so I think keto is too strict for you. Focus on eating fruits and vegetables, high protein and healthy fats, and some grains like brown rice and quinoa, get good restful sleep, drink water, and move your body in a way that you enjoy. Learn to listen to your body and how you feel when you eat certain foods and move your body certain ways and act accordingly. You can trust yourself and your body.   Do not get sucked into the dieting mentality. Yo-yo dieting - losing and gaining weight over and over - is more damaging than PCOS or being overweight.   I was diagnosed at 19 with PCOS and my weight went up and down for over a decade. Worrying about my weight, restricting and bingeing, being obsessed with food and my size took so much joy out of my life and only added stress and anxiety which exacerbated my PCOS symptoms.   Please go to the library or look on Amazon for the Intuitive Eating book and look up the Love, Food podcast by Julie Duffy Dillon who is a PCOS dietitian who does not believe in restricting food to help with PCOS.   Don't fall for the ""weight loss helps PCOS"" stuff. It can but our bodies know what to do and sometimes it doesn't mean we have to lose weight or need to. You're so young and have so much to look forward to. Don't starve yourself. Eat when you are hungry. You are not at fault for your PCOS and neither is your mother for hers. It sounds like you had a healthy diet before so stick with that.   I'm 37 now and still fat, but I'm healthy and active and have periods on my own that I couldn't have at your age and I am finally making peace with my body just as it is.

Theyre both tall and healthy weights and even though the study i read did say that some passed through the breast milk it didnt affect the babies so i figured that a healthy Mum and some trace amounts of medication were better than none and an unhappy Mum.

If I wait to take the second til after dinner and right before bed im sooooooo hungry by the time dinner is ready i massively overeat and then have an energy crash.

"I was in your place when I was first diagnosed too. Firstly, I hope you know that you are not any less of a woman. 1 in 10 women have PCOS, and it's a very common thing. It's been around 3 years since I've been diagnosed and I still struggle heavily with food.      My BIGGEST advice for you is to not go cold turkey! If you love eating pasta, make sure to eat whole wheat pasta and to mix in more ingredients than pasta to make you feel fuller! If you eat rice with your meal, cut your rice intake by half and add in quinoa or lentils instead! Or better yet, cook more veggies/protein so you don't feel so reliant on carbs. I don't eat a ton of dairy, but if you have a craving for cheese- a lot of vegan cheeses are actually pretty good, so maybe experiment with that! I did this for about a year, and now I typically only have carbs in the morning for breakfast! If you can, try to eat carbs in the morning so they ""fill"" you up more; and thus make it less likely for you to binge later on for lunch/dinner (at least from my own personal experiences).      Also, knowing when you feel ""full"" is something I wish I knew before. I grew up binge eating, and always had to feel disgustingly full (like I'm gonna explode full) for me to be satisfied. I didn't realize that this was a problem until I realized that I was eating the same amount of food as my 6'2 boyfriend. I know this is a sensitive topic, but learning what was a ""normal"" portion for me was really difficult. The things that helped me through that was making sure I was FOCUSING on my food. This meant no phones, TV or any other distractions during meals. I also made sure to eat a lot slower, and to really enjoy the food I was eating. I also made sure that I only ate when I was hungry. If I felt peckish, I'd drink some water and wait a while. If I was still hungry but not starving, I'd eat a piece of fruit or something else.      Accept that you are not going to have a ""perfect"" meal every single time. If you ""slip up"" and eat a heapload of pasta for lunch, try not to feel guilty over it. 1 in every 3 women with PCOS have trouble with binge eating/emotional eating. Your body is constantly going through rollercoasters of hormones, and being kind to yourself and WORKING through your struggles will yield better results than beating yourself down.  &amp;#x200B;  If you're looking for easy lunch recipes that are low carb, I'm sure you can find some online but if you enjoy mixed bowls, I usually throw in 2 types of veggies (broccoli and onions, or green beans and zucchini) with a protein (usually chicken breast or a scrambled egg) topped with a healthy fat (99% of the time avocado for me, but do what works for you!).  Some days I literally roast a bag of brussels sprouts and top it with honey-balsalmic vinegar. It's really up to you, but I can definitely understand in being overwhelmed with not knowing what to make now that your primary diet is out of the window.      Hang in there, and even though things seem like they can't get better now, if you just make a tiny change to your lifestyle every day- it'll definitely add up! I mean, if you made a 1% improvement to your life every day for a year thats a whopping 365% IMPROVEMENT!!! Changes are not meant to be implemented suddenly, and hardly ever truly work. Please be kind to yourself and know that it does get better &lt;3",/r/PCOS/comments/fftt3h/pcos_newbie/fk27pa4/,comment,2020-03-09 17:01:53-06:00

"I'm sorry you're going through all of that...  I was diagnosed 6 years ago. This is my experience, so obviously way different than yours...but I felt that I was learning more on my own than seeing my OBGYN. For years I just accepted what my doctor was or wasn't telling me and NONE of my symptoms got better. I was never given any additional information how to manage my PCOS. I felt so lost...why was the internet a better source for me to learn than going and seeing/paying a doctor?   A month ago, with push by family and friends, I went and saw a different doctor. Mind you, this is just a primary care doctor, but she changed my life! I have never felt better (mentally) and now I have the answers that I need. I feel confident that I can manage my symptoms better.   What's worked for me is truly a change in diet, continuing to workout 4 days a week and seeing a Cognative Behavioral therapist. Per my new doctor's orders, I've slowly cut out dairy and gluten from my diet and I FEEL so much better. I carry most of my weight in my lower stomach/thigh region and by staying away from those food groups, I've noticed a decent start to my stomach not being as bloated and puffy.   My mental health has changed for the better. I have very high anxiety/body dysmorphia, so I was told to start taking specific vitamins and stress aids (Adrenal Recovery - everyone should look this up by the way. Very interesting stuff and very relatable) My stress levels are half of what they used to be. Stress, anxiety or any other type of mental anguish can have SUCH an impact on PCOS symptoms. I felt that getting my mind right was my first priority. I'm glad I listened to myself because I truly believe that's the biggest part of how I will manage this for the rest of my life.   PCOS takes so many forms, but the one constant that a lot of people share is how it effects their mental state. As my new doctor told me at the end of our first visit, ""This isn't an overnight fix. But, when you finally get to a point where this is manageable, you'll have had so much practice and learned so much, you'll truly see your body as an achievement. Not a burden or disgusting.""  That really hit me, hard.   I wish the best for you, and I'm so sorry you had to LIE to a medical professional to get the answers YOU need. I don't know if this will help you or gain you any new information,  but I hope that just knowing you are NOT alone in this fight is enough to keep going.   Stay strong and best wishes 💪",/r/PCOS/comments/ffzpzr/update_i_lied_to_my_endocrinologist_for_my_own/fk1mv4n/,comment,2020-03-09 13:40:56-06:00

So elevated testosterone (labs), cysts on ovaries (internal ultrasound) and then physical symptoms; hair loss, hair around your nipples or on your face, less than 3 or 4 (I honestly don’t remember) periods per year etc.   So by her explanation if you have cysts on your ovaries and physical manifestations of the disease you could possibly have low-normal testosterone.

"If you are not looking for long term bc the IUD wouldn’t be for you. Also it is uncomfortable to have put in, and I do have a high pain tolerance (cramps mostly). I didn’t experience any mood changes but I do know someone that did (she has pmdd). I don’t have children so I can’t speak to that part.   Another person I know with pcos uses the ring due to her concerns with mood changes and a long term method of bc and she says that it works well for her. Less remembering, less side effects overall, and it can be taken out if it becomes a problem.   Sometimes I think providers want us to do what they believe is best for us rather than taking all our concerns into account because they have experience to look back on over the course of their career. However, we are the experts on ourselves and only we know how we really reacted to hormones, pain, etc...you are wise to weigh your options and figure out what will work best for you and your situation.",/r/PCOS/comments/f7k04d/period_lasts_5_months/fk1co0d/,comment,2020-03-09 12:02:47-06:00
"first off, the ""normal range"" for testosterone is a statistical aggregate and does not necessarily reflect what is optimal for your or anyone else's body. and doctors will often say ""perfectly normal"" whether you're in the middle of the range or at the very top end of it. it makes a difference, so I recommend calling back and asking for the actual results. many women are told they're ""normal"" when in fact their testosterone is barely in that range and high enough that they are-- like you-- struggling with PCOS symptoms.  second, it could be that your total testosterone is normal but your SHBG is low, meaning that testosterone is more bioactive that it should be. also very common with PCOS.  third, you should have your adrenal androgens (DHEA-S) tested as well, as they can cause symptoms. this is somewhat less likely since you are struggling with weight gain but definitely still possible.",/r/PCOS/comments/ffy41o/confused_about_blood_test_results_regarding_pcos/fk18xtc/,comment,2020-03-09 11:26:53-06:00
"I’m a lesbian with pcos who was diagnosed at the age of 15. When I was diagnosed I wasn’t out to my mother but she went with me to the doctor for my pcos results. I had never heard of pcos at that age and was perfectly happy that I hadn’t had my period in almost two years, but my mother insisted we go to the doctor which I’m obviously grateful for.   When the doctor explained to us what it was my mother asked if the testosterone could also be an explanation for my behavior. I was a huge tomboy as a child, but the doctor said no, pcos does not change behavior or personality or sexuality.  Women with pcos are not more likely to be more masculine and are not more likely to be lesbian.   There was a research that claimed that more women with pcos were lesbians, but that study was not representative as it found candidates at a fertility clinic and who is more likely to go to a fertility clinic?

I doubt that!” and proceeds to look them up in her reference books. She then tells the patient skin tags *are* tied to insulin resistance— but that there is still no relationship to PCOS.

I did not experience a drop in sex drive with my IUD. I also didnt have many other side effects. Some initial cramping but it was only the day of. For me the bleeding all of the time I was having before I got the IUD was a much bigger issue than a bit of cramping. I know everyone is different and can respond to the hormones differently but for me the IUD was the way to go. So much so that I have continued to get a new one every 5 years for the last 15 years.

It makes me nauseous sometimes, and during the period I am still sick but not as bad, they don't seem to be as catastrophic as they are without the pill.

But I also wear longsleeves and jeans to cover my hair arms and legs. Things went great from the first date until I told him he's my boyfriend now. As our relationship progresses, I knew I just had to open up to him if I want an healthy relationship. He wasn't forcing me or anything, but I was hesitant to show him my body at first though I really want to be transparent. He was encouraging me and was telling me that he doesn't mind my hairy body or my scarred skin(because of my skin astgma). We're dating for almost two years now and he's been an amazing partner.

Maybe 200 is your normal. You’re healthy, your labs look great, you exercise and eat correctly. That’s all you can do.”  I still sometimes consider slipping back into the calorie counting and limiting like I did because I like how i looked back then, but I didn’t like how I felt.

"I had a lot of trouble but in the end we managed to breastfeed (and we are still, at 8months) though not exclusively. I had trouble because my milk took ages coming in and when it did, produktion was low. I also didn't release any milk to the pump so that made it difficult to increase supply.  I wish I had been shown how to hand express, starting already before birth and certainly in the first few days.  Research shows that it can significantly increase production to hand express in the days after birth.  I also wish I had known that stress and fatigue are enemies of milk supply. I did allow myself for the first few months to snack around the clock and eat as much sugar and chocolate as I wanted, normally I'm low carb but I had an immense need to fuel my body. (If you want a tip: I made a new mom super fuel by blending 3 dl of rolled oats and putting them in a pan with 100g butter, 1 dl sugar, 3 tbsp cocoa powder, splash of vanilla, 3 tbsp strong coffee. Melt and mix together. I ate this and it helped me stay awake for round the clock feedings and to keep me sane when I was a zombie.)  Also I took a supplement called Shatavari and I feel that it helped with the low production issue I had. It is a helpful herb for pcos and breastfeeding.  For me, breastfeeding didn't really start to work well around three-four months in. By then he'd learned how to do it, my nipples had adjusted and it is also when hormones start to play a slightly smaller role in milk production. So if you want to do it, don't give up if it doesn't seem to work at first.",/r/PCOS/comments/ffoc7f/breastfeeding_experiences/fk0enpf/,comment,2020-03-09 05:47:25-06:00

When I went to the doctor after ten years of no period she did an ultrasound and found no ovarian cysts and told me my uterine lining was very thin. She said my testosterone was over 150 and it should’ve been in the 25-50 range I think...so she said it’s possible I had a tumor (probably benign) that’s secreting the excess androgens.

"The narrow definition is for sure a big factor in this kind of thing, it seems. Some of the trans women I've met really seem like they want to be able to do stereotypically female things without judgement more than anything. It would be nice if things like clothes were less rigidly gendered. Obviously things have changed a lot for women but it's still really rigid for men. I do wonder how many people come to the conclusion that their body is wrong and must change when really it's just unthinking stereotypes about what men and women can and can't do or be. And rigidly binary thinking. It's confusing for those of us who have never experienced it to understand what it is like to be non-binary or trans, but at the same time I feel that some people put themselves through a lot of physical pain that shouldn't be necessary. Anyway my thinking is not very clear on this point so I'll stop.  At any rate, to add my anecdata to the original question, testosterone and sexuality doesn't seem correlated for me. I don't have hugely high levels but they are elevated. I was not much of a tomboy although I'm not really very feminine in the sense that I wear jeans most of the time and only put on makeup if I'm going out to do something (not just shopping).

I have PCOS autoimmune thyroid disease and kidney disease.   I am currently still ebf my 5 month old baby boy.  It was really hard in the beginning because I had a csection so my milk didn't come in until day 3 and I had a flat nipple that bubs wouldn't latch onto.   I worked with lactation consultants to overcome a lot of issues we encountered.   My biggest lesson was that I needed to eat more and more often. I was reminded that weight loss can wait until after I have stopped breastfeeding and to focus on eating enough to feed myself and my boy.  Get help and support early on.

I don’t want to be that person that goes around diagnosing people or scaring you... but have you ever talked to you doctor about the possibility of ovarian cancer?

"You are NOT an asshole. You likely know more about PCOS than most people on this subreddit and I’m confident you have done more to advocate for PCOS than the majority of people on this subreddit. Your comment did not vary from many other responses here, but you were venomously attacked and downvoted. I am incredibly disappointed to see such disparity and discriminatory treatment among a PCOS community.   You are a champion of PCOS advocacy and curtly, but politely, answered a question that was asked. It is ridiculous that because your handle identifies you as a man, people got out their pitchforks.   I myself was taken aback by the question and I am shocked that the degree of insensitivity of it to the PCOS *and* LGBTQ+ community was not ever mentioned.   The pendulum of support swings too far when people are shamed in a community of support for answering a question. He did not insult the OP, her question, or her statements—he simply said elevated levels of testosterone does not make someone gay ... BECAUSE IT DOESN’T. If truth and facts offend you I’m not sure what to tell you.  SHAME on every cyster here who ostracized the OP for answering a question honestly, and for sending a message that men aren’t welcome in our community. We need male advocates and this man is more of a champion of PCOS than most PCOS patients I know.

"This is a good question, because we know that males with reduced in utero testosterone (before they are born) are more likely to be homosexual. This is well described in the medical literature, and for those who don't have access, the Netflix 'explained' series on sex does a summary of this effect. There is further proof that male homosexuality is strongly biological because artificial intelligence can determine if a man is homosexual or not by looking at a mans face alone. There are biological differences, most likely due to the different hormone biology.   Now, your question is, is the opposite true for women? Honestly, I haven't read any studies, I don't know that they have been done in a comprehensive enough way.

"Well, I believe her but I’m ok if others don’t, that’s what makes us unique😉. I do know everyone does have cysts on their ovaries but in PCOS they are more extreme as my gynecologist also confirmed this along with research papers that I’m too lazy to sight right now. The only reason I don’t do bcp is because I have gastritis and other chronic gastrointestinal issues so the bcp which I tried for a week completely made my gi issues exacerbated. I have no problem with others going on the bc if it’s what they want to do. I just don’t like how it’s been shoved in my face every doctors visit even though I have said I don’t want to go that route. Also on the supplement side of things I don’t believe they have a huge impact on PCOS relief. I do know that naturopaths have access to supplements that only doctors can prescribe which are 10x stronger that over the counter supplements. As my Functional Gastroenterologist prescribes me supplements only available by having a script. I thank there is a happy medium when you can combine healthcare with functional medication and make it intertwined and integrative. There is such thing as post birth control pill PCOS but my opinion is that it is extremely rare and over talked about. I think that it’s good to take an integrative approach to PCOS instead of just going internally holistic or pharma controlled.",/r/PCOS/comments/fflei7/is_lara_briden_pseudoscience/fjz9los/,comment,2020-03-08 18:42:27-06:00
"eh, I think it's a little column A and a little column B.   the truth about PCOS and all metabolic sundrome-adjacent conditions is we just don't have many treatment options and what we *do* have is unpleasant. take this pill that fucks with your emotional stability. or this one that makes you shit your brains out. or just stop eating carbs.  ""influencers"" like briden capitalize on people's desperation for *anything* that's a little easier. they latch onto every news report of a possible therapeutic herb or whatever and post about it. throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. the positive is that it gives people hope, and the negative is that it can delay people getting the actual treatment they need because they've opted try ayurvedic herbs and pumpkin seeds or whatever at her recommendation.",/r/PCOS/comments/fflei7/is_lara_briden_pseudoscience/fjz8kb7/,comment,2020-03-08 18:31:08-06:00

I think not sure but think I read something that said versus non pros women there is a higher percentage of people that are lbgtq+... the same is said for autistic women /however/ main thing to remember is correlation does not equal causation.  Whilst it’s true you are born the sexuality that you are it would be something with so many factors I don’t believe it can ever fully be figured out. Also there are gay people whom take female hormones to get pregnant various ways especially if they’ve another condition like pcos and I don’t believe there’s reports of them feeling different in that way,/r/PCOS/comments/ffk0ef/weird_question_but_can_having_a_bunch_of/fjz6xp7/,comment,2020-03-08 18:13:17-06:00

"A lot of what she says is shit lol I’ve seen my ovaries on the ultrasound with one normal right ovary with eggs and then the left covered in cysts that coincide with my pain. The pill also can’t give you pcos considering it’s believed to be genetic. A lot  women just don’t start seeing symptoms until their 20s and 30s. Sure the pill can throw your hormones out of wack after stopping and that’s always been true, but it’s not going to suddenly give you a lifelong disorder because you took it.   A lot of her recommendations are homeopathic vitamins and ya it’d be fantastic if I could just take a couple vitamins and suddenly not have issues, but that isn’t the case for majority of women with PCOS. I tried various ‘natural’ methods before seeking out medicine and the difference was literally night and day. I didn’t see a difference in anything until I started medication prescribed to me. Same with when I was put on birth control at 17 for my pain and irregular periods and at that time I was skinny, fit, and healthy and a poster child for eating healthy.   Some of what she says is filled with mini truths that make it believable, but all in all there’s not really a one size fits all with PCOS and majority of people have to find what works for *them*",/r/PCOS/comments/fflei7/is_lara_briden_pseudoscience/fjz6d9s/,comment,2020-03-08 18:07:01-06:00

"No need to apologise! Your post was a very interesting read and I feel the same as you that I'm probably still an obsessive eater even if my eating isn't disordered anymore. I remember cutting my calorie intake so low without realising that my intake was the ideal for like an 8 year old child or whatever.  You're right about focusing on nutrient-rich foods. That has helped me too - it is so much better to think positively about the food you're eating when it's nutritional and nourishing for your body, I tend to binge while I'm working, so I find eating a lot of vegetable sticks and hummus helps me not to feel bad about binging, but I still need to get the balance right between feeling positive about healthy eating and really negative if I eat really unhealthily in one day.   and yes, this definitely should be discussed more!

"I feel very similarly to you. There is a lot of attention on carb-cutting and as someone who has an unhealthy, obsessive relationship with food it is bad for me to read through blogs and threads which focus on this and other diet restrictions. For this reason I now avoid PCOS discussions which centre around food. Whilst they are now triggering, I sometimes consider how PCOS discussions about low carb eating helped me in a way. As a teenager I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to lose weight on a healthy, calorie-controlled diet so began to cut and cut until my intake was dangerously low, over a period of three years. Through online forums I found that eating a lower carbohydrate diet is a good choice for ladies with PCOS, and that many women struggle with weight gain as I did. This has turned out to be a framework on which to battle my issues with food and guilt. After a long road of trying to reconstruct how I view food, and get rid of the notion of a ‘bad day’ being a day where I ate a some potato or a bit of chocolate, I still stick to the low carbohydrate diet but have slowly managed to let go of calorie counting and severe restriction. I would say that I still have an obsessive relationship with food, and meticulously count the amount of carbohydrate that I consume per day. However, I am slowly but surely changing the mindset which caused me to skip meals and dangerously limit food. As someone who is fairly obsessive by nature, I have found that transferring these tendencies over and focusing on lifestyle choices that are supposed to help with other symptoms of PCOS, and focusing on nutrient rich foods which I should be ADDING to my diet have helped me on my personal journey with food. Especially when I see improvements in other areas like my acne or hair. So those are the kinds of blogs/threads/forums I will still read. I would like to stress that this is not me advocating a particular diet. I want to share my own experiences on this topic in the hope that others going through the same thing know that they are not alone. Sorry for such a long, rambling post... this is my first ever post and your topic is something I really think should be discussed more.",/r/PCOS/comments/ffgaj6/pcos_and_eating_disorders/fjz33dy/,comment,2020-03-08 17:31:03-06:00

At this point, I started seeing a new doctor and he wanted to try letrozole, after doing an HSG to make sure my fallopian tubes weren’t blocked. We conceived after one dose of letrozole.

If you have goals to achieve or things you want to do before having children, do those. You won't regret having done them. Medicine says conceiving after 30 and with PCOS is harder, but don't force yourself to be someone you are not/don't want to be (i.e. a 25yo mom) because of this condition.

"I don't think PCOS necessarily creates irreversible effects on your body, with perhaps the except of excess hair and hair loss - however there is still a lot you can do to help reduce/minimise and even reverse those issues.   Also, as others have pointed out diabetes doesn't just make you fat - it increases your risks for a LOT of serious diseases such as heart disease, neuropathy (and amputated limbs as a result), cancer, liver disease, stroke, kidney damage, eye damage, etc etc. PCOS, if managed well, does not have those complications. PCOS does put you at higher risk of a few things such as diabtetes, high blood pressure and uterine cancer but if you manage it effectively, then I see no reason why your risks for those things shouldn't be fairly similar to the non-PCOS woman.  IMO as a non-expert on the issue, I would say that PCOS could be considered a pre-cursor to diabetes if unmanaged, but no where near as damaging for your body as uncontrolled blood sugar levels are.  Those forms aren't about rating illnesses that you might have as ""your disease is super severe so we must have a checkbox for it!"" so much as ""here's a list of the most common and/or most important illnesses we need to know about"" hence heart disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease etc are usually listed, and then anything else goes under ""other"".",/r/PCOS/comments/ff2e5f/isnt_pcos_diabetes_but_worse/fjxs98l/,comment,2020-03-08 09:42:24-06:00
Your doctor likely wants you to have more regular periods to reduce your risk of endometrial cancer. Your risk increases if you go without a period for more than three months. A 10 day course of progesterone can induce one. Metformin may also help if you’re insulin resistant (don’t rely on fasting glucose or A1C numbers for that; they don’t catch most cases until it’s become borderline or full blown type 2 diabetes).,/r/PCOS/comments/ffdq3o/do_i_have_to_take_birthcontrol_for_pcos/fjxs51q/,comment,2020-03-08 09:41:04-06:00

"I can't answer your questions in regards to the specific birth control you were prescribed, but when people talk about issues with progesterone on here it's usually to do with progesterone only BC which can worsen androgenic symptoms in PCOS women. In my experience, the various combined BC (which contains both progesterone and estrogen) that I've been on didn't do this, but apparently some *types* of progesterone can be more androgenic than others, which means that even a combined BC pill with a higher androgenic progesterone could potentially worsen androgen symptoms.

"Since you've been TTC for over a year now it would absolutely be reasonable to seek testing for that alone, not to mention your other symptoms. Find a doctor who will listen to you and take you seriously. Ideally you'd be getting an ultrasound and blood tests to check your hormone levels. The blood tests should be done on day 3 of your cycle but since they are so irregular the cycle day may not matter so much. Since you are TTC, if you are diagnosed with PCOS you may want to try metformin to start with since that can help with fertility related things.   If you don't get anywhere with doctors, I would suggest trying lifestyle changes and seeing if that helps things.

And my previous PCP thought metformin was unwarranted cause my A1C was normal (my current Endo used OGTT, and lo and behold, there's impaired insulin sensitivity), had me on BCP alone which *worsened* all the symptoms. Doctors seem to be abhorrently behind + I've been getting a lot of the ""don't invent problems, you're healthy, it's just -hysteria- unhealthy lifestyle"" vibe, a bias many doctors seem to have from the start when you bring up PCOS, like we're inventing or exaggerating the issues to have a reason to wallow in self-pity.

I can’t make this up...... they didn’t care that after months of being on it my endo saw that it lowered my DHEA levels, free testosterone and Androgen levels.

"If you mean [this diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/the-military-diet-101#section3) then I would advise against it. It does not look like a sustainable model to me.  What I recommend is to start by grabbing a cheap exercise book and keep track of everything you eat. If you're really serious, you can add notes about how you feel before / after eating. Often when a person is hungry, they can overcome that by just drinking some water.  The second thing you can do is to try and burn more calories where you can. Take the stairs instead of a lift. Walk instead of drive if it's going to be a short drive. Stand instead of sitting when you eat.  No need to go crazy and do super exercises. Humans are very efficient runners, so you probably won't see much benefit if you suddenly start running. Try bodyweight exercises (push ups, squats, sit ups), keeping in mind that doing them properly is more imporrant than doing lots (don't want to injure yourself through poor technique). Grab an empty milk bottle and put some sand in it - leave it somewhere you walk often and each time you go past it, pick it up. When vacuuming, pick up the chairs and put them on the table.  Just try and incorporate whatever extra exercises you can, where you can.  But what you eat is a bigger part of ""getting into shape"" than exercise. By simply keeping a log of what you eat, you might be able to see what you can reduce / improve in a way that you are still happy. You can survive (and lose weight) on very little calories, but if you're miserable or eating unhealthy then it defeats the purpose.",/r/PCOS/comments/ff7oc9/military_diet/fjwtlp0/,comment,2020-03-07 22:32:20-07:00

"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It is tough but know you have a community here!   You very well might have it, and many of these symptoms sound familiar. We can’t diagnose you here but it does sound familiar. You will have to see a few OB/Gyns and even endocrinologists to find the right one but there is definitely treatment! And it’s good you’re catching it early in your life (if this is the cause).  Schedule a few appointments and if you can or want to, bring an advocate. It’s good to know how to talk to a doctor but i find that especially in my early days of PCOS and even now, I sometimes worried doctors would find me hysterical and blow me off. I brought my mom with me and being the determined and med educated woman she was, she asked the right questions. If you don’t have that, do research on the right websites. Come with your list your concerns and symptoms and don’t let the doctor interrupt you; they sometimes jump to too soon conclusions. In the past i have gotten blood tests done and ultra sounds so those are tests you may expect. Some common medicines to treat PCOS are metformin, spirolactane (?) and birth control. They’ve also suggested to me visiting a nutritionist and working on weight loss.   HOWEVER I am not a doctor and can’t tell you want you need. For example, since I’m not currently trying to get pregnant, my treatment is a little different. So talk to your doctor about your concerns.  So schedule some appointments and be persistent with these doctors, if you can, bring someone with you, bring notes regarding your symptoms, do your research (on various doctors in tour area and on PCOS), and just know your pain and emotions are valid and many other women are right there with you and you’ll get through this!

"I think I have both. My PCOS symptoms are missing periods, acne, hair loss, hidradenitis suppurtiva, bloating, high androgens, insulin resistance, dark skin around my neck and underarms, and weight gain. I lost a lot of weight the past couple of years and most of my symptoms are gone but I still have some that I can’t really attribute to PCOS which is why I think it’s something else, namely Endo. When I do intense lower body workouts I start spotting. Sometimes I have cramps, sometimes I don’t. I have tenderness around my pelvic bones that feels like bruising. I also have issues with constipation and a bloated or swollen sensation around my lower abdomen. I also experience lower back pain and sometimes pain with PIV sex that just feels like an annoying pressure. I read that surgery has to be performed to make an endo diagnosis which I’m not interested in getting unless it absolutely has to be done so I’m just kind of assuming for now that I do have it.

"I’m sorry to hear that you’re losing your hair . It can be super stressful &amp; devastating mentally , but there is lots you can do . First things first you might need to investigate and see where the hair loss stems from . No cream or shampoo can address it if we don’t know the reason of it , there is no magic pill . But once you find the cause it can be pretty straight forward . Go to your GP and request some tests :  Deficiency and hormonal imbalance can be culprits of hair loss . And since you have PCOS , make sure you check your hormones .    -check your iron and ferritin : often when ferritin is low , lots of shedding happens , make sure you get full iron study tho ! Not only ferritin   -check vitamin D , zinc , copper (in case your iron is low) , B12 &amp; Folate , Magnesium   -check hormones such as androgens and your thyroid as well : DHEAS , SHBG, free testosterone , total testosterone , Oestradiol (these are just some of them )  -check insulin resistance , since it very common when you have PCOS .   Meanwhile clean your diet , generally concentrating on plant based whole foods , you can even go low carb since that seems to help with the insulin resistance, switch to a sulfate free shampoo &amp; relax a bit because stress can also contribute to hair loss . Wait till you get all your tests back and once you know what’s the issue you can properly address it . And just remember to first take care of your body as a whole and address the culprits of your PCOS , once you do that your hair will grow back !

Yes. I have it and do not have either. But did have high anti mullerian hormone levels consistent with PCOS. I also had an ultrasound done which showed between 20-25 follicles on each of my ovaries and I think “normal” is below 12.   Not sure if your doctor will do all of that testing.

"TLDR: I also get rashes that I'm fairly certain are from PCOS. Managing stress, eating clean/staying hydrated, and prioritizing sleep have helped reduce the rashes/itchiness.  I was just diagnosed in December and I'm *just* starting to get a hold of my symptoms, so take this with a grain of salt. One of my most outward symptoms that I associate with PCOS is skin rashes.  I've had eczema for most of my life on and off, but nothing like the past year before getting diagnosed.  This post is getting fairly long, but the rashes that I have were the thing that got me to finally go to the doctor and address the issues I've had my whole life... In a weird way my body outwardly forced me to take care of myself and get the help I needed, and I think your body might be saying that to you too!  I get the rash around my eyes and along my hair line, in the past its showed up other places.  After I cut out dairy gluten, and as much processed sugar as possible, the rash calmed down, and seems to get better daily.  The rashes around my eyes were really scary, my students were all very worried about me.  The rash around my hairline also goes down my neck and around my ears, and isn't super visible but is fairly uncomfortable. Thankfully both areas have gone down significantly, but it was a real struggle for about 4 months.  I know that mine is related to stress. I've also noticed when I eat very clean, am hydrated(inside and out - I've been using Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion and it seems to soothe, any calming moisturizer would do the trick), and most importantly manage that stress, the reduction of itch/rash is significant.  Sleep has also been really helpful across the board, but I can see a difference when I don't prioritize sleep in the severity of my symptoms.  Good luck my love, this is my first post on reddit after being a lurker for a while, I hope I'm doing this right...!",/r/PCOS/comments/ff0mgu/itchy_skin_rash/fjwbt33/,comment,2020-03-07 20:18:01-07:00

"Avoid levonorgestrel at all costs if you struggle with hair loss in any capacity. I know that sounds dramatic, but my experience with the Liletta hormonal IUD (which contains levonorgestrel) has been terrible. My gynecologist thinks I've always had mild PCOS (I've had irregular periods from the get-go) that went unnoticed until the IUD was placed. Her best guess is that the levonorgestrel tipped my androgens into the red zone (since they were presumably already elevated) and caused more noticeable symptoms. After I got it, the hair loss came on suddenly and it was relentless.  Obviously, IUD's are very different from the pill but be cautious of levonorgestrel regardless.

"I am so pleased for you that your PCOS isn't the worst thing in the world! That's pretty amazing.  For me, and lots of women, it is.  For those desperate for children. Or desperate to feel like a woman. Or those desperate to lose weight.   On a negative note: My PCOS murdered my first pregnancy. My PCOS caused me to be 3 times the size of a normal human being My PCOS caused me to lose most my hair and grow a thicker beard than half of my ex's. My PCOS took away my ability to feel like a woman. My PCOS is the reason my heart stopped and I almost died during weight loss surgery, desperately trying to treat my PCOS. My PCOS is the highest contributor to my anxiety, depression and agoraphobia. My PCOS is the reason I've never been accepted by anyone.  Prior to surgery I had years being the lab test rat trialing tons of drugs for weight loss and PCOS. I was forced into a million diets and starving myself. I was bullied, beaten and abused for the way I look because of PCOS. I had a BMI of 55.5 and got to the point I would just refuse to eat or throw up anything I dared to try. I couldn't even take my child to school because I was so ashamed of being the fat mum at school.   But on a positive note: living with PCOS has built my strength and courage and taught me to keep fighting for my health. I went through 3 surgery attempts till I successfully completed surgery. I now take my daughter to school every single day. I won't stop at nothing in order to make sure there's more help for her, my little 9 year old. Who has shown signs of PCOS since birth.

"I’m so sorry you are going through this. I can tell you that I’ve had 3 significant episodes of hair loss that have each lasted a few months where bald spots were starting to show through.

The third time (recent) I started using viviscal shampoo and conditioner. It made my hair look thicker.    Each time the hair loss eventually slowed and things went back to normal. It grew back. There were a few months that the shorter hairs would all stick up creating cowlicks and general funky appearance, but it did eventually grow back, just as nice and thick as it was before the episode.   I know how frustrating it is. But as long as you don’t have scarring on your scalp, it will eventually grow back. The viviscal really worked.

"&gt;Women can look however they want and still be a woman... but that doesn't mean you don't have your own ideas of how your body should be, as well as the social pressures towards ""how woman should look like"".  Intellectually you know the first part, but that doesn't mean you aren't still impacted by the second and third part.   Please be kind to yourself, and dont beat yourself up over it. There aren't really easy answers to this, but it's certainly something other women with PCOS suffer with - I've seen a few posts like this before. You can tell yourself that women can look a certain way, you can unlearn the social stuff thats bombarded on people since birth, but i don't think that necessarily changes your internal feelings. I mean, I did all that and I'm still a trans guy who wants to look a certain way physically and be percieved as who I am inside. And I think that's the same for cis people too (most of them are just already at that point so no mismatch between inside and out).  So I guess... this response is probably not very helpful, but while I do think you can learn to accept yourself more, body positivity and all that; what I'm trying to say is your internal feelings are valid. They are real and it really is okay for you to feel that way. It isn't problematic or whatever. ""Women can look however they want and still be a woman"" just means ""don't misgender people based on their appearance"".  It doesn't mean ""you personally not being okay with looking masc (though I'm sure you don't) is bad""... your personal identity is not transphobia or anti-gnc or homophobia. So please don't feel shame over that.   If you feel like you are burdened by social pressure, of course take time to unwrap that... but again, in my personal experience there's only so much you can unlearn before you know who you are and how you want to be. Like, sorry to keep using myself as an example, but I could accept being short because society's obsession with men being tall is dumb but I couldn't accept appearing physically feminine because that's just not who I am. Even though there are other (trans and cis) guys who can! It's just personal....  And yeah, the gendering of hormones is totally bogus! It seems almost self hating sometimes when people to use that language you mentioned... speaking as a dude who does take extra Testosterone not just from PCOS lol.",/r/PCOS/comments/fetkz2/pcos_makes_me_feel_like_less_of_a_woman_cw_for/fju30x2/,comment,2020-03-07 13:30:37-07:00

"Hey! So my pain is intermittent when it flares up, but it’s pretty constant when it is there. Changing positions can alleviate it seemingly for a moment, but not permanently. It’s so frustrating. I can’t point to one position or other that definitely seems to help me though. When I was diagnosed, I was told the pain can radiate from the ovary to what feels like the uterus and then also the back. So it feels pretty bad!  I didn’t know that about endo! My current doctor said she didn’t even suspect it because I was on BC and have been for several years, so your results may vary there. I do not know how my stepmom was diagnosed but I know her pain was quite severe. She said it felt like her bowels were being twisted.  As far as diet, I don’t do keto but I do low carb. Learning to cook was a big help! I aimed for around 50-80 carbs a day, tracking my meals for a week or so. But I tend to eat the same things every day for a week or two until I need a change up because it’s easier to shop and prep for. A typical day for me is a meal replacement shake, yogurt, cheese stick (Colby and mozzarella), chicken broccoli spinach and mushroom casserole, mini bell peppers with spinach and artichoke dip, and scrambled eggs with breakfast sausage for dinner. I’m currently making a frittata! It’s been great for pushing me to learn how to cook. It’s so overwhelming at first.  I take a multivitamin with ashwagandha, the latter just for mood and anxiety  Berberine for blood sugar management (it works like a charm! I thought low carb enough would manage my insulin spikes but this has been the game changer)   Turmeric for inflammation  Magnesium for depression, but it also helps with muscle pain and blood sugar levels as well as a few other things.  L-theanine occasionally for relaxation.  There are so many I’ve read about. I didn’t know where to start! I’m sure there are others I could take that could help but so far this is all I take. Oh and some L-lysine for my chapped lips lol but that’s unrelated to Pcos.  I hope you get it all figured out and can stop being in pain! Do you think you will go to an OBGYN at some point?

"I liked what you had to say. I'm feeling a bit brain dead now, but just wanted to let you know that, and add a bit. I have PCOS. Dxed at 26, though I knew something was amiss at 14, when they gave me bcp to ""regulate my periods"" (they were constant). Not had much treatment for it. No dr. has thought it was important except the one who dxed me, but I moved. I was fertile enough, so why would we care? /s Now I'm approaching menopause, so I'm afraid to even look for a new gyn. and endo. No reason to start caring now, right? I feel very marginalized, and I have other health issues (some which are certainly related tho) so PCOS is on the back burner for me, too.  I don't have extra testosterone. This is what prompted me to write. At least, last 2 times my free testosterone was tested, it was actually lower than a woman's should be, at any age. This may contribute to my lack of energy. Who knows? Just wanted to point out that high T isn't necessarily a factor. I do (or did) have really high DHEA, and fairly low female hormones for age and cycle.   I'd like to see someone, even if they are slightly quacky, who would do some hormone panels and help me out with my levels. I'd love to take a small amount of testosterone and whatever female hormones would be appropriate. If transgender people can do it to feel better, I think it isn't unreasonable that I could do so, to match the gender and body I am fighting to live in a little longer. There used to be a product called Estrotest that might've been a good start, but I guess they don't prescribe it anymore...  OP, I hear you, and I don't think what you are feeling is strange. Sometimes I feel a lot like you do. Since I was a child, I've tried to embrace the sort of androgeny I sometimes feel, and it can be ok. But sometimes I feel like it's been forced on me, too, plus the premature aging that comes with just not having enough hormones (breasts gone slack more than expected, no hips, belly, the hair loss, etc) and that I am not ok with. But I don't know how to get what I want, and I'm so damned tired trying to figure it all out.

"There were doctors at the time and they've left writings. Diabetes was known but it was consider an exceedingly rare disease. For example, if a doctor writes that he has seen it only twice, and you estimate that he has seen 2000 patients in his career, then you can guess-estimate 0.1% incidence.  Keep in mind nobody was obese so there was no obesity-induced diabetes. Nobody was sitting on his chair all day long either. Nobody could afford to eat meat every day. In an environment like this it's really hard to develop diabetes type2. You can still develop type1 due to autoimmune problems.  Diabetes was described as ""excess urination"". They basically described the glycosuria. PCOS was of course described as ""women looking like men"".

In some studies vegans have a \~80% reduction in incidence. Currently in most countries incidence is around 10%, if you do a 99% cut in incidence you go down to 0.1%.

"Despite the dysphoria or dysmorphia you feel about your body, you’re in good company here because other women have experienced similar feelings you’ve felt about feeling defective or less than woman because society stupidly hinges femininity on the ability to reproduce.

They see you and say “That’s u/GreasedTea, and she’s my friend.”   The same love you give needs to be given to yourself. You may be out of touch with some women, but there are lots of women who feel similarly to you when they see additional facial hair sprout, watch the scale climb despite careful diet and exercise, hear the difference in their voice drop over time, flipping calendar pages to find the last time they had a menstrual cycle, stare in disgust as thick hair sprouts on their belly or arms, wince in pain when a skin tag you didn’t know was there catches on the goddamned seat belt...doubling over in pain once the body realizes it’s time to rip out the uterine wallpaper that’s been up for a few months...experiencing sharp pain periodically and cynically wondering if you’re actually ovulating or if there’s a follicular failure to launch (an egg)...happening to look down at the waste bin in the restroom at work and seeing that the rest of the women in the office are having their periods while yours is MIA...feeling super awkward when the women in the office talk about their kids or plan a baby shower for a coworker who’s pregnant...having to verbally spar with people when they won’t shut up about “when are you gonna have kids”...  *I’m touching on just the surface here.*   Don’t let the dysphoria and dysmorphia take hold.

I've found another: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164771/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164771/)  &gt;The prevalence of PCOS appears to be only minimally affected by the  increasing rates of obesity and the excessive consumption of  Western-type food. For example, the prevalence of PCOS is relatively  similar across countries with different rates of obesity (e.g. United  States vs. Spain or Mexico) ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164771/#R5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164771/#R6), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164771/#R10)).  Likewise, we have been unable to detect significant differences in the  dietary intake or composition of women with PCOS compared to matched  controls ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164771/#R12)).  In a study of over 600 unselected women from the general population,  the prevalence of PCOS increased minimally and non-significantly with  increasing body mass ([13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164771/#R13)).  In contrast, the average body mass of over 700 women with PCOS  diagnosed over a 15-year interval increased linearly and in concert with  the increasing obesity of the surrounding population ([13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164771/#R13)).  Taken together, these data suggest that the epidemics of excess caloric  intake and overweightness play a limited role in the development of  PCOS.  This is very bad news for you PCOS sufferers.

So it's just **one** peasant woman and we don't know her socioeconomic status. Maybe she was a rich peasant with a lot of land and several large herds of animals. The fact she was obese does suggest that she didn't have to work hard to get (high-calorie) foods. Obviously when you've to work hard to get **calories** it's very difficult to become overweight.  I'm in Italy and I know the history of diets and diseases here. I know that ~2000 years ago the incidence of diabetes was around 0.1% of population. Average BMI was ~20. I don't know about PCOS but surely they didn't have much PCOS associated with obesity and diabetes simply because **they didn't have much obesity and diabetes**.

"Sure! It was maybe 15 years ago when I first heard that, not sure where I read bout it originally but here’s an early reference:   “The earliest known description of PCOS was written by Vallisneri in 1721 in Italy when he described a ‘young married peasant woman, moderately obese and infertile, with two larger than normal ovaries, bumpy, shiny and whitish, just like pigeon eggs’.  It was not until 1935, when Stein and Leventhal presented a paper identifying the syndrome at a meeting of the Central Association of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in America, that PCOS began to evolve from being ‘a gynaecological curiosity’ to what is now considered a multisystem endocrine disorder. It was originally called Stein-Leventhal syndrome.”[early PCOS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987282/)  And here’s more PCOS history going back to greek  times: https://medium.com/@drjasonfung/diabetes-of-bearded-women-79d2db6efc14",/r/PCOS/comments/fed42i/pcos_in_the_16th_century/fjp1n2i/,comment,2020-03-06 17:07:35-07:00

First, almost every middle-aged woman on the American diet already has breast cancer. There are lot of potential customers.

For PCOS, it affects only 10% of women on our diets and lifestyles and once you've diagnosed them you can't sell them any costly treatment anyway. You see it's a waste of their time.

"To be fair, it is not necessarily the medical researchers that make the decision of what they do and do not get funding for. Grant writing is disgustingly competitive and, while unfortunate, if a grant committee reads something about treating triple negative metastatic breast cancer vs. something chronic and somewhat manageable, guess who is going to win the grant. It's not necessarily that the researchers don't care, it's just how the field is. And once you get funding from a grant, you must rigidly stick to what it was you that outlined in the grant proposal. There is very little flexibility. The only places that flexibility to explore different research topics really exists is at the National Institutes of Health Intramural program. And while I do not know of any labs at NIH doing research specifically on PCOS, there are many studies and whole labs dedicated to study what chronic inflammation does to the body, ie cancer, heart disease, etc. and what the risk factors can be for this. As we know, chronic inflammation is a hallmark of PCOS and from my understanding, is likely the root of what manifests from the condition.  In my opinion, it is important still to do research on PCOS specifically, but it will take us not being quiet about it and advocating for it.

"My mom and I both have PCOS. My entire life from youth through college, I knew her as being 400 pounds.

"I used to work for a dermatologist, these are the over-the-counter remedies the doctors would recommend to patients.  Differin is probably the best medication you can get over-the-counter. It used to be prescription only but is sold in stores now. It can make your skin dry, so start with just using it every other day and be sure to use moisturizer. It's degraded by sunlight so only use it at night.  For face wash, there are some good acne-fighting ones on the market. Benzoyl peroxide is a stronger acne-fighting ingredient but can be very harsh for sensitive skin (I can't use it, personally). If you can tolerate it, PanOxyl is a good brand. Salicylic acid is more tolerable for a lot of people. Neutrogena has some good, gentle salicylic acid face washes. If you do buy a medicated face wash, make sure to leave it on your face for a minute or two before rinsing it off, you need to give the medicine a chance to penetrate your skin. If you want one that's not medicated but just overall cleansing and gentle, CeraVe or Neutrogena make good options.  Moisturizing is key! You don't want your skin to be super dry: the dead skin can clog pores and cause more acne, and oil production can go into hyperdrive, causing more acne. Be sure to moisturize at the very least after washing your face and applying any topicals like Differin, but ideally moisturize both morning and night. My personal favorite is the Neutrogena Hydroboost water gel - its super gentle and doesn't leave a greasy film on my face. If you need something more intense CeraVe AM or PM are good options.  While it's important not to get so much sun that you seriously burn or tan, a little sun on your face every day can really help. If you can, 15-30 minutes of sun (without sunscreen) a day can help.   As for diet, it's really individual what may make you break out. I break out from too much sugar/refined carbs, and I have a friend who tolerates sugar fine but breaks out whenever she eats peanut butter. Maybe experiment by eliminating one thing at a time and seeing if anything changes. The most common diet-related acne triggers are refined carbs, dairy, and fried foods.  If you still have persistent acne after trying multiple over-the-counter approaches, seeing your  primary doctor or dermatologist is your best bet. Sometimes people just have stubborn acne and need a little more treatment (I had to go on accutane because NOTHING else worked well enough). There are many prescription topical medications to try if you don't want to take oral medication. And if you're okay with oral meds there's several antibiotic options, spironolactone, and accutane.",/r/PCOS/comments/fearci/help_for_acne/fjo0ipg/,comment,2020-03-06 11:07:33-07:00

I remember being sat in this doctors office with my mum and dad (who are also slightly overweight due to health conditions, but it has no affect on their daily lives or movement or anything like that) and the doctor simply telling my mum “she’s obese. She needs to stop watching tv and get off the sofa. Stop feeding her takeaway and chocolate. But that will be difficult for you two, won’t it?” Had a lasting impact on how I viewed myself.

"Definitely call around to different pharmacies, but also call the doctors office and ask if they can submit a prior authorization form for the brand name medication. That’s a form they submit to insurance companies that better explains why you need that specific medication over a generic; they can explain that you’ve tried and failed other generics and the nuvaring. That can sometimes get brand names covered. I used to work for a dermatologist and had to do this for brand name meds all the time.

"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, sending lots of hugs your way. PCOS hair loss can be such a fickle bitch to deal with. I've been dealing with it off and on for a while now so I'll share what works  for me. In my case it seems to be almost entirely about insulin resistance so the more I target that the better results I see.  * currently taking 1000mg metformin * low carb/keto diet, focusing on unprocessed foods e.g. non starchy veges, normal protein intake (meats, tofu, ocassionally beans/lentils), and healthy fats such as nuts, avocado, coconut oil, small amounts of dairy etc. The lower carb I eat the better, and it is probably the single most effective thing imo. * regular exercise - anything you can do, even walking, is better than nothing, so start slow and build up. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity.  In addition:  * ketoconazole/nizoral shampoo can help, since it's an androgen blocker * supplements - I'm currently taking vitamin d, pregnacare (for ttc more than hair) and algal oil (vegan source of omega 3). If not taking a multivitamin, I would take b12 and folic acid as well. * finally, this is going to sound weird but, in my recent experience your household water supply could be having an effect. My hair seems to HATE the tap water in our current flat. I've been experimenting with using filtered water to wash my hair and so far I seem to lose much less hair with it. It's a pain because it takes a while to prepare a jug of warm filtered water before my shower but it's worth it, my hair looks nicer and hopefully it will start regrowing soon.   It may also be worth seeing a dermatologist to rule out other potential causes of hair loss. And get your thyroid checked if you haven't already. Good luck, and if you have any more questions or want additional support feel free to PM me :)",/r/PCOS/comments/fe1vlg/should_i_have_any_hope/fjmhwmi/,comment,2020-03-05 22:04:13-07:00

What’s your metformin dosage? 1500 mg daily is usually the effective dosage for PCOS; I personally didn’t get my periods until I hit that dosage.   Birth control isn’t your only option if all you want is a period. I can’t tolerate birth control so I have a standing order for progesterone if I go more than three months without a period.

"Hormones and hair growth is the worst to deal with! As a women with extreme hair growth, I do too spend a lot of time and energy with removing hair but I also have learned to love my hairy self.  The most effective hair removal is electrolysis hands down! No saving before an appointment like you need to do for laser hair removal, which saving only makes the hair follicle grow more course and thicker. But staying consistent with electrolysis appointments for a course of months or years is needed for the most effective and permanent method of hair removal! When I was 21 with a full on women beard, after trying treatments of laser hair removal, I found electrolysis and never went back. I went once a week for at least an hour for two years straight with only a handful of skipped weeks bc of life! At the time I didn’t know I had PCOS with extreme hormones fluctuations.

This can get lonely. SURROUND YOURSELF WITH UPLIFTING PEOPLE! If they ain’t hyping you up, you don’t need them.   Second lesson:   You’re a boss ass bitch. You’re 22, self aware, and are going to go do great things that aren’t related to your appearance or hair growth patterns at all. You’re a soul with purpose not a damn heifer for a livestock show. Grow the chin whiskers, cut or shave that cue ball or rock a wig and/or head accessory! Guess what else would fit on that nothin of yours? A GOTTDAMN CROWN, YOU BEAUTIFUL GODDESS!   Third Lesson:   The worth you have in your skills, heart, and mind are FAR (like, by a fucking lot) FAR more valuable than one hair on your head. Your beauty is not married to your hair. Your intelligence isn’t measured by how high that pony tail can go. Your capacity for compassion isn’t scaled by the peachy fuzz on your chin.   Fourth Lesson:  Cys, listen.

I’m not sure if I can take the progesterone - I was told by my doctor that I’d have to avoid any kind of hormonal medication due to the migraines the pill caused me - apparently it heightens the risk of stroke.

"I think it depends on what you want.  If you're looking for fertility the most recent advice is very specific: get in contact with a reproductive endocrinologist and start ovulation induction with letrozole and then proceed from there.  Low carb tends to be helpful for fertility as well.  Ovulation induction alone can bring about live births in about 1/3 of women and isn't very expensive.  Many RE will recommend supplementation such as myo-inositol and vitamin D.    If you're looking for reduced hirsutism the typically prescribed medicine is spironolactone.  This is a hypertension med and not all doctors will prescribe it depending on your health and their knowledge of PCOS.  If you're looking to lose weight and have better overall metabolic health and slowly correct your symptoms, then low carb diets are the best method as they directly address the hyperinsulinemia that drives symptom expression, and tend to be the least friction method to lose weight with PCOS.  Because your periods are so irregular you should probably get on cyclic progesterone to trigger them at least every 3 months to prevent uterine hyperplasia.  Progesterone triggers a natural withdrawal period and is much easier on your body than birth control, though obviously actually ovulating is better.  If all of these sound out of your wheelhouse, my simplest advice for facial hair alone is: shave.  It sucks to do and feels masculine but is inexpensive and tends to cause less skin problems compared to waxing or plucking.  Hope that helps!  If you need resources on anything specific I can dig them up, or you can search the forum and you'll find lots of good ncbi links on these topics.",/r/PCOS/comments/fe3un7/need_some_updated_ideas_in_how_to_help_my_pcos/fjlpzca/,comment,2020-03-05 16:43:30-07:00

"I need waist to hip, not hip to height, hehe. :)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist-to-height_ratio  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist%E2%80%93hip_ratio  I've read about this disease only for a few days now but I've been interested in diets in general for a few years. My understanding is that PCOS is very much aggravated by hyperinsulemia (the medical-speak for too much insulin after meals and even in the fasted state) (it's normal for insulin to rise after meals). Hyperinsulemia is caused primarily by eating high carb foods while you're insulin resistant. To a lesser extent also high protein foods will trigger the problem. You're insulin resistant primarily because of these factors (in approximate order of importance): 1) being overweight 2) being sedentary 3) eating animal-origin foods 4) eating high fat foods.   In summary then if you just stop eating, you stop triggering the hyperinsulemia, and you stop triggering many of the hormonal imbalances of PCOS. And your hairs could immediately start growing back and within a month or two you should see some results.  What you can eat? The low calorie high nutrient foods veggies like cruciferous vegetables and salads are safest choice. Then i would also add a few beans, lentils and peas so you've a minimum of starch and protein so you're not starving too much. A few fruits are OK. Then add vitamin b12 and iodized salt and maybe some vitamin D (or even better, some sun exposure) and you've a reasonably complete diet (you can check this on chronometer if you care). Drink water and only water (if you're addicted to coffee then you'll get some coffee withdrawal).  When you reach ideal body weight you can relax a little on the diet and eat some more of the high calorie foods. I'm a male and not PCOS and not overweight and I basically eat the above diet because I enjoy it not because I have to. In fact I'm underweight so I've to try to eat as many high calorie foods as possible (I've to eat pasta, bread, etc etc). This diet is called ""low fat vegan"" or ""low fat whole food plant based"". Those eating this diet for health or for fun are at /r/PlantBasedDiet. It'll also improve your mood. :)  I'm not sure how PCOS is related to weight gain, it must be some hormonal issue, you probably can't stop eating, you're always hungry? Fixing the hormonal issues should also fix your appetite so you get this as a bonus too. After a few days of eating a restrictive diet like this you should be much less hungry (paradoxically).  Those who love animal foods and fat will tell you to live off animal foods and fat. I think this is the wrong prescription. This is an alternative fix for the hyperinsulemia, at least in the short term. It'll worsen your overall health though.  Once you've fixed the hyperinsulemia, you'll still have PCOS, but probably a lot fewer symptoms. You'll have the so called ""lean PCOS"". I think if you fix the hyperinsulemia with the right foods you can come very close to ""healed"".  To minimize problems you've to be really lean, BMI should probably be below 22. I've tried to summarize everything you need to know in a post. Let me know if it's not clear.  P.S: Do NOT lose hope. You CAN be very beautiful.

"I'm 29, 5'7. Also a PCOS fighter, and also know the pain and embarrassment of hormone unbalance. It sucks when it come to hair growth on your face, arms, stomach and chest.  It's a chronic illness and basically a disease that has little awareness. I was diagnosed back in 2015 after switching doctor's who said I was just fat and lose weight. For 10 years! I could have been properly diagnosed and tried to start something to help my life go easier?  My highest weight was 260lbs and feeling like I could just die. Depression set in. More stress on my body.   My husband has encouraged me to do intermediate fasting back in September of 2019. He has brought it up for years since my PCOS diagnosis. I have tried everything. But damnit I love food! So I did the hardest thing. Self control. So in August I slowly began to eat smaller portions. I met with a nutritionist to help my eating habits and to be educated on fasting.  September I began my 20/4 fasting. No carbs(bad kinds). No suger. No soda/pop(ONLY WATER).  Lettuce wrap ham sandwich for lunch to replace the bread. And wow I fell in love fast. Had a cup of baby carrots with a tablespoon of red pepper hummus. I started my 4 hour eating window at 3pm and ended it at 7pm. Then fast for the other 20 hours.  This gave me the opportunity to have dinner with my husband and a small ""late"" night snack(peanuts/plain air pop popcorn). I learned you have to have one small meal and one large meal, and to drink water anytime you get the feeling of hunger. Your body is actually thirsty, not hungry!? You can pick which way you want to start. So I have my large meal at dinner.  For meat: Fish, chicken legs, chicken breast, pork. About 4-6ounce of meat. For veggies: baked sweet potato, califlower, broccoli, mix veggies, zucchini, peppers, carrots, black beans, garlic, onions, lettuce. Load up. For others: brown rice, while grain rice, quinoa, mayo, buffalo sauce. Be careful, on some condiments, read serving size and cut it in half.  Pick one day of the week, and only one! That is your cheat day! It restarts your body from cell hibernate into burn and burn. Just don't go over board lol. But have that hamburger from McDonald's. It keeps you from feeling deprived. It's really what you are preparing. I have a spicy lunch to suppress my appetite, and to increase my body heat to burn what I got during workouts. Workouts: FitOn(app/free) palites or simple strengthening workouts. Sit-ups. Up know the fun stuff. (Lol) one light dog walk around the block four times a day. Nothing major.   I am now 213lbs as of this morning. Small and simple changes with self control, discipline and a supporting system to keep you going is the best results!  My doctor, two weeks ago put me on Yaz-28. She said it's supposed to help dramaticily on hair growth, regulate monthly cycle's and reduce ovarian cyst. Little by little our health care provider in the obgyn is getting the tools they need to help us gals in the PCOS world. It's not great, but it's better.

"I’m 43 and diagnosed with PCOS in 1990 as a teen. The facial hair is annoying. I finally got a script from my dermatologist for Vaniqa and I love it. Ive been using it for about 15 years now. Keeps hair down to a bare minimum and helps me use other hair removal methods less frequently.   Vaniqa, unfortunately, is considered cosmetic and not covered by insurances ‘mostly. I got a refill last week $185 for a 45gram tube. When I first started getting it in the mid 2000s it was $75 and the tube was larger. 🤔   My mom is a huge help and pays for this for me sometimes so I’m never without it. You can use it up to 2x a day but once a day is good and doesn’t burn the skin as much. Also as I got older my PCOS related acne went away. I also got on the Metformin to treat the insulin resistance that’s common with PCOS.  Thinning hair on the head is a problem too. I cut my hair super short so the thinner areas are barely noticeable.

"I think that if there were an emergency situation serious enough to cause major food shortages, it would be more important to worry about having enough to eat in general than worrying about sticking to a specific diet. I totally understand that nutrition is one of the main ways that a lot of us keep our symptoms at bay, but in a choice between starving or eating carbs, I'd choose carbs.  Now, keep in mind, I don't know about any of your other underlying conditions. Obviously someone with celiacs can't just go stock up on pasta. But for many of us with just PCOS, eating food outside of our normal dietary restrictions for a few weeks would not kill us.  The medical appointments is what I'd be more worried about depending on a person's type of prescriptions and level of care. I work in a state program that allows the elderly and disabled population to receive care in their homes. I also work with skilled nursing facilities. I think individuals with higher level of care need to be prioritized. It all just depends on whether or not you need your medicine to survive (diabetics, asthmatics, transplant patients, epileptics, immuno-compromised, etc. you get it.) It all just depends.

"I don't know where you live, but don't let the media and panicked doomsday preppers get you alarmed. I am not a doctor but have done a tiny bit of research to keep myself up to date with how to protect myself and my family. The general consensus seems to be that if you're in general good health and not elderly, you are most likely going to be fine if you do somehow contract the virus. However, practicing good health hygiene is recommended- washing your hands often, sanitizing when you can't wash, sneezing into your elbow, not touching your face or rubbing your eyes, etc. The same kinds of things you should be practicing during flu season anyways. I tend to practice these habits anyways because I've worked in healthcare and know how gross people can be. I haven't touched an elevator button with my finger in years lol.I think I've also seen that they reccomend you get your flu shot, if you haven't already (at least in America).   If you do live in a city where an outbreak has occurred, or even if you live in a highly traveled large city with tourists, I would suggest avoiding large crowds when possible. If you wanted to be even more intensely over-the-top careful, you could always remove your shoes and clothes when you re-enter your home. Leave the shoes in a designated area that you sanitize regularly, and wash the clothes as soon as you take them off. Follow this with a shower. (I believe these things are unnecessary and don't really know if they would protect you from coronavirus, but I am a germaphobe and this is what I would do when I worked in a hospital and didn't want to track whatever I had been working with home to my family.)  Like I said, I am no doctor. But using my judgement based on what I've read, I don't think there's a need to stockpile vitamins or toilet paper or anything like that. The media is whipping everyone into an unnecessary frenzy. I generally tend to lean towards alarm in these types of situations, so doing the research is how I cope with that. After I've learned more about it, I am much less alarmed.   Hope this helps :)",/r/PCOS/comments/fdwu15/pcos_and_coronavirus/fjk9yxo/,comment,2020-03-05 08:46:21-07:00

"I'm late to the party but god damn, this was literally me one month ago. Now, I reintroduced whole carbs and avoiding fruits and sugar. Feel so much better. I eat around 120g of carbs per day. I use fats as flavorings basically. Like today, I had a soup with a bit of potato, carrots, cabbage and I added \~50g of heavy cream (crème fraiche).   I do IF, mostly 16 to 20h. I've actually no issue whatsoever. It just took some days for my body to get used to carbs and now, my mood is WAY better. I simply avoid refined carbs, sugar, fruits.    Keto made me moody and so unhappy. And I was working on every aspect (electrolytes, fat ratio, protein etc).    If i want to snack on my eating window, i'll go for greek yogurt or some nuts. My meals are mainly around whole carbs and fat for flavour. I'm also a lacto ovo vegetarian so it was exhausting to see ""fatty meat"" (even though I know it's not around that but huh).     I personally believe that being too long in ketosis is not what our body is meant to. Fasting can get you on a well balanced burning fat. Even inuits have a special gene which stop them from ketosis.

"You may also want to get an ultrasound to check for any uterine polyps. They tend to thrive and grow when your body doesn’t shed its lining often. Symptoms are spotting and they can cause heavy periods. I hope everything works out for you; they can be such an inconvenience.   Some background on my own situation and why I’m suggesting checking for polyps -  I was spotting, not having periods and cramping, so I went to the doctor who performed an ultrasound and found polyps. She put me on progesterone to force a period but then found that I had endometrial hyperplasia, so she kept me on progesterone for 3 months, and I also started Ovasitol. I had two REALLY heavy periods during that time.  My polyps were removed about 3 weeks ago or so, I’m still on Ovasitol and progesterone, and last weekend I started a cycle that was more like my normal flow and not overly heavy.

Definitely see an endocrinologist if you can! They can help you because they are a specialist in these types of  issues. Hypo and PCOS are both hormonal issues and IBS could he as well if your body isn't producing the right types of hormones to initiate digestion or digest food. Maybe there is an underlying issue with your pituitary that causes all three.   I had Hypothyroidism and PCOS too. I know the struggles. I often had digestive issues that I have no control over.

"A few key things I’ve learned along the way:   1. Low carb. Limit yourself to 1-2 servings of carb per day. But always choose whole grains when eating bread, noodles, oatmeal, etc. make sure you get some carbs as they’re important for brain function.   2. Low sugar! This is important as PCOS is often caused by insulin resistance (simple carbs such as white bread and regular noodles break down into sugar causing your blood sugar levels to spike and crash, this is bad for the long-term causing type 2 diabetes and other health issues)   3. Veggies always!   4. Limit red meat, eat salmon and other lean fish, poultry, and mostly plant-based proteins. Beans, nuts, Avocado, etc. are great for women with PCOS  5. Exercise as often as you can (ideally 30 mins/day). Even if it’s just walking or cleaning the house - anything helps!   6. Metformin helped me a lot personally   7. Always always avoid trans fats!

"The best diet for PCOS is a ketogenic one.  Metformin is a first step, but it's not as good as a low-carb diet.   ""Currently, there are no  pharmacological treatments for PCOS, thus researchers have started to  look into dietary and lifestyle interventions for treatment. While it is  hard to determine if the insulin resistance that is so commonly seen in  PCOS is a result or cause of the condition, the fact that insulin  resistance is present, offers up a therapeutic target: improving insulin  sensitivity.   New research suggests that improving  insulin sensitivity⁠—and weight loss⁠—are likely the most effective  means to treat PCOS. In fact, losing as little as 5 to 10 percent of  body mass (i.e. 15 to 30 pounds for 300 pound female) can significantly  improve hormonal imbalances, increase fertility and reduce the rates of  miscarriages. (7) Furthermore,  increasing insulin sensitivity will reduce excess androgen hormone  production, normalizing the balance between LH and FSH.   Since improving insulin resistance  and body weight seem to play such big factors, the ketogenic diet offers  a very promising dietary intervention for PCOS.   ## Impact of the Ketogenic Diet on PCOS  The ketogenic diet is most notably  known for its impact on weight loss, epilepsy, type 2 diabetes,  neurological disorders, and even certain types of cancer. (8) |  (9) |  (10) |  (11) However,  due to emerging research and anecdotal evidence, keto is now being  considered for many additional conditions, such as PCOS.   Besides the fact that eliminating  excess glucose from the diet will significantly improve health  parameters, low-carbohydrate diets have been proven to be remarkably  effective for reducing insulin concentrations and improving insulin  sensitivity. (12) |  (13)   Since the ketogenic diet can improve  insulin sensitivity and aid in weight loss, researchers have started to  look into the diet for treating females with PCOS. While the research is  limited, it is promising; a 2005 study in a small group of obese women  diagnosed with PCOS found that limiting carbohydrate intake to 20 grams  or less per day for 24 weeks resulted in:  * 12% reduction in body mass * 22% reduction in testosterone * 36% reduction in LH/FSH ratio * 54% reduction in fasting insulin levels  While these findings demonstrate  proof of concept for utilizing the ketogenic diet for PCOS, perhaps the  most impressive finding was that two women from the study became  pregnant during the study despite previous fertility complications! ""  [https://keto-mojo.com/article/keto-treatment-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/](https://keto-mojo.com/article/keto-treatment-for-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/)  The blog I linked has references to scientific studies backing up their claims.

Just briefly looking into it it seemed like the male hormones in pcos women are elevated and in children who are born with neurodevelopment disorders had shown to have increased male hormones in their body which messed with their chemistry. Normal women don’t have these elevated male hormones. That’s why it says that’s why many males are born with autism rather than females.  These studies have no clue about me and my experience and imagine how many clueless women are out there who don’t know either.  This is a big deal! My son has suffered because of me most likely.

"visceral fat is a telltale sign of insulin resistance, which is also a major component in the pathogenesis of PCOS. reducing insulin levels consistently over time will get you a flatter belly, but it's not a quick fix. here's the key things to know:  * you can't target a particular area for fat loss. your body is gonna shed pounds where it wants when it wants. you can't ""reposition"" belly fat without eating at a deficit and losing weight.  * there are three prongs to the protocol that works best with PCOS: **1)** low carb (start at 100g/day and work your way down to where you start to see an effect) **2)** intermittent fasting **3)** metformin or berberine",/r/PCOS/comments/fdl891/pcos_dieting/fjictjd/,comment,2020-03-04 16:34:44-07:00

lol you won't die. it's a chronic disease and our healthcare system really isn't built to handle that kind of thing... it serves patients best when they have something acute that can be cured with medication or surgery and PCOS requires a combo of supplementation and lifestyle changes. I was hospitalized with an infection a few years ago and the treatment I received was wonderful. the treatment I've received with PCOS is a whole different ballgame.   so there's not much doctors can do for you anyway. tests are certainly helpful but only tell you so much. metformin is really the only medication that addresses the root cause and berberine does the same thing with fewer side effects.,/r/PCOS/comments/fdjb81/advise_for_doctors_visithave_you_ever_experienced/fjib2wf/,comment,2020-03-04 16:17:41-07:00

"I'll tell you executive summary. When you're overweight and sedentary and eating ""everything in moderation"" your insulin is elevated compared to truly lean and athletic people. For some people it's more elevated and for others it's less elevated. It's elevated both when fasted and after meals (all people have more insulin after meals, but people who are obese and sedentary have more than the healthy people).  Is this a problem for people? Maybe it's a problem for PCOS? We don't know. At least I don't know. It seems a physiological response to the not so physiological state of being overweight and sedentary. Now it turns out that the overweight and sedentary people usually eat a lot of high fat foods, like meat, cheese, eggs and oils and it also turns out that if you eat ONLY these foods then you can drive insulin down to more physiological levels (despite you're still overweight and sedentary). Is this a good thing? Again, we don't know. Maybe for some people it's good.  You see we simply don't know. The people who love the above mentioned foods like to believe that once your insulin is driven to physiological levels by any mean whatsoever then every health problem is magically fixed. This is just delusional.  I'm reading the link she provided to see if there is this smoking gun linking hyperinsulemia to PCOS. I'm not finding any smoking gun there.  The two main arguments she uses are from this:  https://journals.aace.com/doi/abs/10.4158/EP15748.DSCPT2  And this:  https://sci-hub.se/10.1385/ENDO:30:1:13  I'm reading the last link to see what they've got really.",/r/PCOS/comments/fdjb81/advise_for_doctors_visithave_you_ever_experienced/fji7a38/,comment,2020-03-04 15:43:23-07:00

"[non-alcoholic fatty liver is universally associated with insulin resistance](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/91/12/4753/2656230#52627360). this stuff is all connected, and small changes can kill multiple birds with one stone. it sounds like youve been getting bad medical advice for years and your PCOS has spiralled. I'm so sorry youve gone through this.  what I'd do is ask for a full metabolic workup including HOMA-IR. I'd also consider an elimination diet to see if something you're eating is causing your digestive issues, though it sounds like what I went through with just run of the mill insulin resistance. the good news is it can be reversed very quickly! I got my testosterone down to normal and reversed my symptoms in about a month on a ketogenic diet.   first of all, get yourself some berberine. it's over the counter. start with a 500mg/day dose and work up to 1500. it might cause some temporary stomach upset. also get some inositol and take 4000mg/day. 2000 in the AM and 2000 in the PM. you can also try a NAC supplement 2x daily (1000mg day and night) if you want. and magnesium is always helpful and soothing.  your doctor is right about sugar. try to reduce the carbohydrates in your diet and eliminate sugar. start by targeting 100-150g/day and work your way down until you find a daily intake that works for you. tools like carb manager really help!

"&gt; I know it’s best to avoid alcohol  I mean... it's best to avoid binge drinking every night but you can absolutely have alcohol. just stick to low carb, low sugar options: unflavored liquor has no carbs. I'm not a liquor drinker myself I stick to a glass or two of dry wine if I want a drink but as long as you're not using a sugary mixer you're fine. cooking wines are fine as well. to be honest I don't keep track of any of that kind of stuff. you're in college lol I get it you don't have to be a nun.  as for *how* low carb it depends on your lifestyle and what you can tolerate. I started with capital-k keto 20g of carbs a day to make sure I was in ketosis to reset my metabolism. I still eat very low carb but I've eased up on counting: those 2 months of being really strict got my body working again and I haven't had any issues. I even had a little bit of brown rice the other night (sacrilege!)   anyway that's what worked for me. I tried going from high carb to lazy low carb and it didn't work, my body clearly needed a ""detox"" from carbs. I know that sounds really unscientific but that's the only way I can describe it! if you have the tolerance to start with keto it's really the quickest way to get your metabolism back on track quickly, but I understand that it's not possible for everyone. I can't speak highly enough about it: I lost about 20 lbs (135 -&gt; 115, I'm 5'5"") in like 2 months, my belly flattened out, hair grew back, periods came back. **BUT**-- and this is important-- I'm a sample size of 1. my results are not necessarily typical. the science on PCOS and metabolism is still emerging.   so all I can recommend is do some experimentation. listen to your body, it's actually very communicative. try and get a feel for what your individual carb tolerance is. maybe it's shit like mine was and you need that intense reset or maybe all you have to do is cut out sugar and processed food.

"Well, yes and no. Alcohol tolerance is mostly built on weight, gender, genetics, and how much you drink.  If you are smaller than one of your friends, it'll usually take less for you to get drunk than them. Genetics could also change that around with how you process alcohol in your system. Females usually have a lower tolerance than males. And someone who is an alcoholic will have a higher tolerance than someone who is drinking for the first time.

I’m almost 36 and have never had a desire to birth a child. It’s just not my thing. I was raised in a very religious family and they always thought when I got older I’d change my mind because God’s purpose for me was to be a mother.   When I date I’m usually very upfront about this early on because I won’t change my mind. I’m just not interested in having a child or changing my life style to accommodate one.  If that’s a deal breaker I’d rather know early on. Although I have had a couple of boyfriends claim indifference and then later start talking about starting a family one day thinking I’d change my mind.   People always told me I’d change my mind and I never have. When I was 26 I asked to have my tubes tied just to be sure. My doctor said to ask again at 35. Well I’m almost 36 and I finally got the green light. While PCOS makes it less likely I’ll get pregnant there are women with PCOS whose hormones level out at least somewhat that can make conception more likely in your 30s than your 20s. I don’t want that to be me. I had some push back initially but explained I made this request almost a decade ago and I haven’t changed my mind.

"If you want to work with your doctor, very low calorie diets -- for about 3-6 months -- can be very helpful.  Your body is in ketosis a lot of the time so you feel less hunger and your insulin levels will drop which helps PCOS.  Because you would do this with a program you get a lot of support and it might help you get on the right track.  When you are coming off it be sure you have a dietician who supports low-carb.  If you end up eating refined carbs (I'm not talking zucchini and lentil soup here) then you'll regain all the bodyfat and your insulin will get high again.  A lot of times for surgery you are told ... to follow a ketogenic diet for several months before the surgery and if people stayed on that diet they wouldn't need a major procedure.",/r/PCOS/comments/fcvil8/has_anyone_tried_a_weight_loss_medication_to_jump/fjfeic3/,comment,2020-03-03 19:48:59-07:00

"I'm really sorry you're in a rough place right now. I've been there before too and know just how hopeless and off things can feel. This is just a just a hard time, though, and it will pass and things WILL get better.   College was when my PCOS symptoms first came about (I think for me, it was exacerbated by a very poor diet) and I dealt with a lot of depression and anxiety because of the hormone imbalance those different factors were causing. It was something that I struggled with for years until I finally got diagnosed with pcos and found a great specialist doctor who had me change my diet. That diet change helped my hormones get back in check and I couldn't believe how much better I finally felt! My point is, is that whatever is making you feel so down can be fixed and you can feel better.   I agree with what another poster said, open up to those who love you and don't be afraid to be selfish and do things for yourself- it helps so much! Maybe see a doctor who specializes in pcos who can help get things in check or talk to a therapist about how down things feel right now. If you think taking some time off of school and focusing on something else (or just yourself!) do that too. Sometimes taking a step back and lowering stressors can help a lot.

"As a fat person, I try to avoid talking about what people are eating (unless we’re sharing a meal/eating dishes together) and other people’s bodies. It makes me so uncomfortable when people do it to me. In work environments, it does feel judge-y &amp; mean when people are like “I wouldn’t eat a carb if you held a gun to my head.” That can come across to as fatphobic &amp; ableist, &amp; can feel personal. Also, so much controversy surrounds the keto diet (at least here in the US) that it has influenced the way a lot of people respond to it.   I know my vegan &amp; paleo acquaintances especially tend to be pretty ableist &amp; fatphobic in their messaging on social media. But bottom line, it’s not my business what they’re eating unless it’s my job to feed them! I had to make it clear to family especially, many times, that due to my PCOS &amp; PTSD, I’m not ok having my body or what I eat discussed. It took a while but they are good about this now. It helps to enforce the boundary as soon as they step over it. It’s hard, and frustrating, but it’s important. Sometimes I don’t have the spoons for it, and that’s ok, too.  I don’t think it’s helpful to conflate PCOS with diabetes mellitus, as some other users are suggesting. They are definitely NOT basically the same illness. Telling people false medical information doesn’t help either group of patients. There may be commonalities between our illnesses but the fact remains that they still aren’t the same. We should be sharing facts about PCOS if anything. There’s no need to exaggerate. PCOS sucks enough!   It’s good to vent here. People here understand. But expecting people without chronic illnesses to get it may not be realistic. This is part of ableism, really.

"Mid/Late 20s. Long before I got my diagnosis (PCOS was evident in puberty but no one knew what was going on), I was told I probably couldn’t. Being young, I definitely didn’t think twice about it. The only thing that bugged me was the “broken” aspect. Feeling like I didn’t function correctly.  I digress...  Now, I am indifferent. And I mean that. If I have a kid, then great. I do not want to subject myself to fertility treatments and if it doesn’t happen, I’m not losing sleep over it.

Doctors have force fed fertility treatments information down my throat... ya know... just in case (with a wink). My boyfriend of almost two years feels the same way- whether he’s a dad or the cool uncle he’s content with life. It helps me to know that I’m not disappointing anyone... (the possible future in laws may be another story).  I just like to think that one day we will stop assuming every woman wants children. I hope doctors treat every woman the same regardless of her journey to motherhood (I have been turned down for additional PCOS related testing because I’m not TTC).   So you’re not the only one.

"This is a totally normal workup.  I think my initial workup was something like 15 labs.  They need to confirm your diagnosis and exclude other possible lookalike conditions before treating and double check your general health as well.  There's no way to be sure that it's PCOS and not CAH, for example, without running the tests as the symptoms are the same.  Many doctors feel there's also no purpose to treating without confirming your tubes actually work, and will frequently do the sono first before putting you through hormone therapy.   Most of the time these labs can be picked up from anywhere and so it's not your clinic necessarily even getting money from running them. (I ran most of my blood tests locally because I was far from my clinic.)  Often times though ordering these from a fertility clinic is cheaper because they specialize in these tests and can do them more efficiently.  (This was definitely the case for ultrasounds as the no-insurance cost for ultrasounds at my clinic was 1/5 the cost of the hospital ultrasound.)  Keep in mind that reproductive fitness is a whole-body condition.

"Check the hair loss/thinning tag to see what a lot of people use to try to get some hair back. Once you lose it, I've heard it's very hard to get back, so it's mostly a chase to try to prevent yourself from losing more hair than necessarily regrowing.. But many people on here have had luck regrowing hair after starting spironolactone and/or rogaine for women.

"I have used OPK (specifically Easy@Home and Premom's Semi-quantitative) for all 9 of my letrozole cycles, and they worked great.  I use the Easy@Home every day and the Premom semi-quantitative once the ratio of test line to control line is above 0.5, so I only use about 3-6 semi-quantitative per cycle.  My RE actually recommends the use of OPK (though they don't require a specific brand or anything) so that folks can tell if they need to come in early for ultrasounds and so they know how to properly time a progesterone test. (I use the Proov strips for progesterone rather than doing labs, but I'm cheap.)  Here's my [4rth chart with letrozole + OPK + BBT](https://imgur.com/jF8afEN).

"The sonohysterogram is actually important. It will make sure your tubes are open. If they’re not for whatever reason, you could potentially waste time on clomid, letrozole, or injectables. If there’s a blockage, getting you to ovulate won’t matter if the egg can’t make it where it needs to be.   The genetic testing is pretty standard too. Remember these doctors don’t just see patients with pcos, they see women with all sorts of reproductive disorders and difficulties. Their ultimate goal is a healthy baby, so making sure there’s not some crazy genetic disease your offspring could have is important to them.

"From what I have learned women with pocos have insulin problems, in most cases it is insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia) which means that insulin is concentrated on high levels throughout all day basically, but it could also be reactive hypoglycemia (a sudden rise of insulin just after a meal). Considering the percentage of women with pcos who also develop other conditions related to insulin (metabolic syndrome) I think that the hypothesis of insulin as the main driver of the condition is accurate.

"For me, it took the motivation of trying to get pregnant to take the plunge into a major change and sticking with it. It clicked for me when I needed that outside motivation and goal for something other than just my own health. I also found out that I am an all or nothing type of person - I either need to be strict on a diet (no little cheats here or there), otherwise I'm going to find an excuse to cheat any time a tempting food was in front of me. Realizing that helped me majorly. Other people have had more success cutting out one thing at a time.   It is incredibly hard to get going on a major diet change. I put it off for kind of awhile. Starting out, it felt so alienating because I had to be a diva when ordering at a restaurant and it sucks to not be able to eat what everyone can eat. I'll never forget my first holiday party after getting strict on a diet; there was not a single thing that was compliant for me to eat, and I cried in the bathroom because being different sucks.   Even though it is hard to get going on such a major change, I will say that now that I've completely cut out gluten, dairy, and sugar (sugar detox was the hardest!) that I don't crave them anymore. It's no longer difficult to say no to them, and it's also no longer sad either haha. I feel a million times better and that gives me the motivation to continue the diet. My family knows that I keep a strict diet and they are wonderful and accommodating when I'm around. It gets better!

"I'm fuming after reading your comment. I am so sorry your shitty doctors dismissed your chronic symptoms for years. Were you diagnosed with the type 2 younger? I've had ignorant doctors say diabetes is only common for older adults i.e. 50+ and how young people rarely get it. I strongly hope your incompetent doctors were held accountable for delaying and neglecting you prior to your later diagnosis because I'm sure you advocated for them to take precaution.  The medical community is a fucking shit show when it comes to female related endocrine issues. How could a doctor who spent 12+ years in school not know that insulin resistance leads to type 2 but continue to shrug it off in a female patient with hirsutism, acne, hair loss, depression, insomnia, fatigue, etc?

Saxenda is great in my opinion if you can handle the side affects. It will make you extremely nauseous.

We know it's unlikely to come from deficiency in carbs because the fasting insulin didn't change.  **I don't know how to explain these trivial concepts in a more trivial way than this.**  If you think ketosis is so great then why you're not in ketosis?

Why you're not in ketosis if it's so great?  &gt;and of course they would not lose any lean mass with SUFFICIENT PROTEIN.   Sufficient protein? Sufficient for what? For adults the protein that is sufficient to avoid loss of lean mass is also sufficient to avoid any serious ketosis. This is why no adult is on a truly ketogenic diet for long term. Even for children they're extremely dangerous and they stay on these insane diets as little as possible.  &gt;Ketosis is evoked from CHO restriction, and this can come from diet (in which case the bulk of the calories are from fat, as was the case here if you had read the paper) or from fasting. Fasting, just like the ketogenic results here, LOWERS INSULIN RESISANCE.  Ketosis is evoked by SEVERE carbohydrate deficiency. Unfortunately SEVERE carbohydrate deficiency causes loss of lean mass. To mitigate this you've to increase intake of protein. This will minimize ketosis. Hence, ketosis is almost impossible to maintain for adults. This is why you're not in ketosis.  &gt;Fasting, just like the ketogenic results here, LOWERS INSULIN RESISANCE.

If those excuses don’t cover the food I am trying to avoid, I never outright say no (because then people get annoyed and start to bagger you into compliance), but I just procrastinate (omg that looks great, cannot wait to have some later, but I just ate and I am so full). If they think you will comply, they will leave you alone.   If it’s a large enough gathering you can even fill a plate partially up with said food, and when people ask just say you already ate half of them.

"congratulations!!   on metformin: yes it helped, it reduced my persistent bloating almost immediately. yes there were side effects but they were mostly in the first few weeks.   on low carb: remembering how bad I felt when I ate that stuff is motivation enough for me. try to find some craveable low carb foods that you can eat instead.

"I've found a quote that reminded me of your behaviour! :)  &gt;For me, that old Atkins book is a window into the low standards of the low carb world. Atkins’ story is the typical low carber story. The starting point for him was obesity – triple chins in his case – and a sense of anxiety about food. “Even the idea of hunger scares me,” he wrote.  &gt;The low carber wants to be shown a way to eat high amounts of calories and yet look like he doesn’t. Foods are not fuel but luxuries to be slathered – “It’s luxurious to slather mayonnaise on your cold salmon.” The obese individual assumes the role of someone to be envied. Those pork rinds will attract longing stares from suffering friends. He wrote, “It’s fun to crunch away on those delicious fried pork rinds, while your friends who are on calorie-counting diets watch you enviously.” Why should the obese person have to eat “rabbit food?” – which is what he calls celery and carrot sticks in the second excerpt. We all  deserve better than a rabbit, right? We deserve gluttony. Look at the last line and note the extreme weirdness of Atkins describing how a matzoh ball soup – a traditional Jewish dish – could be made with pork rinds – a most un-kosher ingredient.

"I am not a doctor but I will tell you what I know.  The pill blocks your ovulation but just as long as you take it. When you stop taking it ovulation restarts. If ovulationis lazy to come, there are medications and lifestyle changes that can help bringing it back.  Taking the pill helps with knowing when you will be bleed, it's great for practical reasons. Having a period (as in, renewing the lining of your uterus, even without ovulation) is something that protects you against some illnesses and some kinds of cancers. That's part of why doctors put us on the pill, because it makes sure we bleed and protects us that way. Without it, some of us might never or only rarely have periods and that can be a risk factor.  Regarding the experience with the pill, everyone is different. The first pill you are prescribed might not work for you. Some people are specifically sensitive to certain side effects more than other. It's a trial and error process. It can be a bit of a nightmare for some and a walk in the park for others. I had no side effects whatsoever for the first 9years taking the pill, then started having a bit of issues and am finding new treatment options.  Quick solution. The underlying cause of PCOS is still being debated, for many people it's insulin resistance. The pill does not treat this but sometimes, getting the hormonal situation in check is enough to take care of any existing insulin resistance. It then is an effective quick solution if this is the case. If that does not happen for you (you still can't lose weight or you gain weight with little to no reason) a low carb diet and Metformin can be added to your treatment regimen to fix insulin resistance. In this case unfortunately the pill was not the quick solution one might have hoped for.  The pill is often a good way to manage your condition before thinking of pregnancy. When you will want to get pregnant you will stop the pill and start trying to conceive. Not managing your condition might make your overall health worse and make it harder to get pregnant later, but there are other ways of managing this condition than the pill.  You are entirely free to prefer avoiding the pill, then you should discuss other options with your doctor. However, the pill is not an inherently bad suggestion and your fear of forever blocking ovulation is unfounded (otherwise no young women would take it). The pill can have side effects, but your doctors can help you with that. For example if you are prone to migraines, some pills are to be avoided. When you start a pill, give it 3 months to settle with your body, most side effects reduce or vanish in that time frame.

"It's actually apparently super common to be insulin resistant with PCOS. The current understanding seems to be that insulin resistance is what drives PCOS due to excess insulin causing the ovaries to produce excess androgens which causes things like wonky periods, acne, hirsutism etc. Which is why a lot of treatment is geared towards reducing insulin via meds (metformin) and/or lifestyle changes. I also wouldn't have considered myself IR either but targeting IR has been pretty effective for me.",/r/PCOS/comments/fcjqva/periods_gaining_regularity_is_this_normal/fjcin6x/,comment,2020-03-03 00:47:46-07:00

The Ovasitol May or May not have helped. I lost 4lbs the first week and I haven’t lost that kind of weight in such timeframe since I was a teenager.

"I started spironolactone for hormonal acne back in August and it’s been amazing! I had really bad  acne all along my chin, jaw and neck. The spots were big, painful and deep, and it seemed like as soon as my spots started to heal, a new set would pop up, and then those would heal, and then the same old spots would pop back up in the same places. It was a never-ending cycle that really hurt my confidence and brought me to tears. I had tried keeping my face as clean as possible without over-doing it. I tried clindamycin, expensive serums, products with no unnecessary ingredients, chemical peels, babying my skin, etc. The spironolactone took a couple months (2-3) to really start working but it helped me a LOT. My dermatologist also prescribed epiduo, which makes my skin look really smooth and flawless if I actually keep up with it. However, I’m satisfied enough with just not having acne that I don’t keep up with using the epiduo all the time. Keep up with the spiro and don’t lose hope! If there’s one piece of advice I could give you- it would be to try to not let your acne interfere with your quality of life. I really let mine get to me and it ruined my mood, my confidence, and my summer (which is my favorite season).

"I'm in a very similar situation, I definitely recommend a dermatologist, they can help get things under control fast! Can I ask is this a new birth control you've been put on? In my situation I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and they immediately started Tri-Sprintec. Within the first month I started experiencing terrible cystic acne just like you are describing- worse than I've ever had. I did some research and went to the derm and concluded that it was actually the birth control, making things worse before they got (slightly) better.  So what I'm saying is it very well could be going on the birth control that caused this- if it is in fact a new and recent break out. My dermatologist put me on a sulfur wash and a Clindamycin/Benzol Peroxide wash which really helped. They also did some extractions on my cysts (painful, but really helped).

"I'm 33 and in my 2nd cycle of TTC now. What helped with getting to this point was going off hormonal BC a couple of years ago (I couldn't be on them anymore anyway), using condoms for BC instead, and managing my PCOS without the pill. For me that means low carb/keto diet, regular exercise and metformin. My PCOS symptoms are now mostly under control and my cycles average 40 days and I think are ovulatory. Now that we are TTC it was just a matter of removing the barrier (condoms) and see what happens.

"Hi OP, I'm 30 soon to be 31, have diagnosed PCOS and currently 19 weeks pregnant. And to say the truth getting pregnant was easy. Both times I got pregnant within 2 cycles.   Important things are : Are you menstruating regularly? If yes are you ovulating regularly?  First one is easy all you need is a calendar. Second is a little more complicated.   If you are not menstruating you are not ovulating. The hormones that cause you to release an egg also cause you to have a period. So ovulation == menstruation  But sometimes you produce enough hormones to cause a period but not enough to release an egg so. Menstruation =/= ovulation.  Only way to know if you to check at home if you are ovulating is measuring your BBT. R/tryingforababy has way more info than I can write here on measuring ovulation.  What did I do? Basically followed the advice given in the tryingforababy reddit.  Just because you have PCOS it doesn't necessarily mean you will have problems getting pregnant. Statistically you have a higher chance of needing medical intervention. But PCOS =/= infertility.

"It's different for everyone. Some women with PCOS get pregnant easily, others need limited medical help, others need a lot of medical help.  If your cycles are relatively regular odds are better that you will not need as much help.  If your cycles are very long then properly timing intercourse to catch ovulation will be hard so you will want ovulation induction.  Personally my husband and I started in 2017 when i was 33.  I'm now 35.  We spent the compulsory year trying with no success as my cycles were 100 days long.  I learned about BBTs and OPKs that year and stressfully tried to implement them without any success.  In 2019 we finally got to our RE and she put me on letrozole and I've done 9 cycles, 3 monitored with ultrasounds.  I use OPK for all cycles.  I've ovulated 7 times in a row since being put on my current doseage.  I had a chemical pregnancy in my 4th cycle.  I am also a T2 diabetic (well-controlled with a 5.0 a1c) and I eat very low carb to keep both my blood sugar and hormones in order.  I think this has contributed to my very reliable response to the letrozole.  My doctor let us know at our most recent appointment that we also have some mild male factor infertility, so we are converting this cycle to IUI.  We don't plan to do very many IUI as it is not sustainable for us due to our distance from the clinic and the cost (about $1k per cycle). After we have tried and failed a few IUI we will need to consider IVF.  My BMI is currently too high (even having lost 45 pounds in the last year) but I still have a ways to go before I reach my clinic's limit for IVF.  We will need to take out some big loans to do IVF, and I will be at least 37 by the time all this happens.  I started out pretty optimistic, but with the addition of male factor, it has been a real bummer.  I will say that the low carb + letrozole worked really well for controlling my PCOS though.  Without the MFI we would probably be pregnant by now.  My recommendation would be not to waste time with your PCP and gynecologist.  Get yourself to a reproductive endocrinologist right away.  It shouldn't even require a referral: just look up fertility clinics in your area.",/r/PCOS/comments/fck1dq/new_to_this_forum_and_wondering_about_getting/fjb84rj/,comment,2020-03-02 15:33:11-07:00

"It's totally fine! And that's definitely true, unless it's so obvious like a broken arm or something visible they tend to not pay attention to it. I've also had fibromyalgia since I was 11 and they still after 8 years whenever I mention my pain tell me ''have you tried ibuprofen'', oh you mean like for the past 8 years lmao, and it took 2 years just to get my MOTHER to find out it seems to be an actual illness whilst day said ''growth pain''. Everything that is invisible or is seens as something ''small'' like balding, losing hair, body hair etc. is just dismissed as being normal or something weird but nothing to look into :/ So I'm always happy when I see women in this group talk about putting these doctors in their places and proving that they were right all along, hopefully it makes an impact for future women going to those doctors :)   And I'm sorry to hear about the rogaine not working! :( Personally my dcotors are super slow so all I've had is birth control, so all I could recommend for potential hairgrowth is flaxseed gel hair mask as its the only thing that made me grow a few baby hairs back and is just homemade flaxseed gel mixed with some oil like argan/olive. But ofcourse even though remedies like that can help, if it is hormonal it can only do so much so I hope you can figure out the issue especially if it is the IUD!   And thank you, I'm happy too but sadly I still have to wait 23 days until march 25th, and I'm not even sure if the gyno will take my blood as that is not their job so I'm pretty sure I won't even get my blood tested that day, I just hope she will agree and refer me to get the correct tests as soon as possible :)!   Also just wanted to add that if you do wanna try something natural for your hair (personally dislike natural stuff but in hair care I've found it atleast makes my hair break off less), then look up flaxseed gel hairmask by ''alexandrasgirlytalk"" called I grew my hair back, and maybe try a leave in hair rinse which is just boiling green tea or black tea and putting it in your hair after conditioner, some people say it helped cause of the caffeine. There's also fenugreek water and amla said to also be good for scalp hair growth. It is hard to find so I just stick with flaxseeds for now as it worked for me somehow and most ''hair growth'' remedies are just for longer hair not thicker, but these things are said to maybe help. So if you ever think you might wanna try it you could check these out maybe :)!

"They only tested my hormones after I told my gyno about my irregular periods and my acne, my two main symptoms. They only really did it to confirm their existing suspicion of PCOS.  Personally most gynecologists and also probably endocrinologists will probably go ahead and diagnose and treat symptoms as PCOS in women who have irregular periods, acne, hair growth and/or weight gain that likely isn't and can't be attributed to any other disorder. And although not everyone with PCOS has the same symptoms, irregular periods are like the #1 symptom usually followed by either acne or weight gain and hirsutism (abnormal hair growth). If your periods aren't irregular they probably don't suspect PCOS, but rather a different hormonal or otherwise unrelated disorder since PCOS directly affects the menstrual cycle. I'm not a doctor I just don't think they'd diagnose PCOS in someone with regular periods (assuming you have them since you didn't specify if you did or not). PCOS is a pretty easy thing to diagnose through a multitude of tests (hormone panel, ultrasound to check for cysts, etc) or even just verbal communication of symptoms.   I also don't think PCOS necessarily causes digestive issues, I'm sure there's probably a correlation between IBS-like symptoms and PCOS but afaik it's not a symptom considered in the diagnosis of PCOS. Unintentional weight loss is NOT something that happens in PCOS, if anything the opposite happens. That's usually indicative of a gastrointestinal issue afaik. If your periods are irregular, make sure they rule out any outside factor like maybe something like malabsorption or low body weight, those can cause periods to be irregular and sometimes even stop completely.   I'd go see a gastroenterologist honestly. Have you been checked for things like Crohns or Celiacs? Gluten sensitivity and intolerance can apparently also affect certain hormones.

"When I got the razor I just searched amazon for one with really good reviews in my price range.  It is the standard, two-sided, razor (which is different from the butterfly types).  I like Sharp blades the best (but Astra, Derby, Feather, and Shark are great.  I suggest staying away from Gillette, even though there are tons of good reviews.  I find that they dull really easy).  I find that they are sharp enough to shave my chin hairs (which are incredibly tough) without getting dull.  I change the blade every two face shaves, or if i do a full body shave I may use two razors or one (just depends on the amount of hair).   I did buy a brush, and used it for a while.  Now, I never use it.  It is enough for me to use my hands and really hot water.  I feel the best with the shave when I can shave in the shower and let the hot water soothe my face.  But if I cannot shave in the shower I just try to hold hot water in my hands and ""soak"" the shaved area in it for a while.  If I do not use this hot water technique, then I get itchy or bumpy face. It is also important to lather up the soap.  I use just regular bar soap;  lather it in my hands until its think (not sudsy, but a creamer texture).  It usually takes just a few seconds to get the soap right.    Everyone had always told me ""why don't you just shave it?""  I never did because I was afraid of having a rough face, even darker and thicker facial hair, a shadow, and being further embarrassed with my appearance.  I also worried people would make fun of me more than they already did.  I am sure you know what I mean;  ""Why do you have facial hair like a man?  Why don't you just get rid of it?  It is so gross!""  Shaving one's face is a guy thing, right?   Well, in a fit of despair I decided to say fuck all this effort of keeping my appearance fit for the public and I sought out a razor brand sharp enough to give me a close enough shave that I would be satisfied.  Well, there were not any brands like that but I figured out that safety razors just are sharp like that.  I tried it, and realized shaving one's face is a people thing, not a guy thing.  I do not have a shadow, darker or thicker hair, and no one even mentions my facial hair.  Possibly because I never have to let it grow in and they may not see it, and possibly because I am around different and better people than previously.   I just love shaving it because it saves me not only money, but SO Much Time!  While I was spending 100s of dollars every month, I was also spending hours every week just on my facial hair.  Now, I spend about 10 minutes max on the whole ordeal.  This decision probably saved me more heart ache than anything else I have done for myself.

"metformin should regulate your sugar, not cause a dip. probably a good question for your doctor! or you might try berberine as an alternative, many people tolerate it better.  and you should ideally not have those high highs and low lows at all. it's very damaging on many levels. what you should be targeting is a nice even blood glucose that stays in the ideal range. what happens when you have metabolic syndrome and you eat a sugary, carby meal of your glucose spikes waaaay high, then your insulin spikes waaaay high, and this causes that massive crash. the natural response to that crash is to eat more sugar which then repeats the cycle. people (myself included) get trapped in this cycle for years and it inevitably leads to weight gain because it creates an artificial hunger: your body has plenty of fuel from the last meal but the hypoglycemia forces you to eat more. rinse, repeat.   when you eat mostly protein and fat rather than carbs and sugar you don't get that blood sugar spike which means you don't get the crash either. this is why these sorts of foods keep you satiated so much longer.",/r/PCOS/comments/fcb0ek/metformin_vs_berberine/fjan8h2/,comment,2020-03-02 12:20:13-07:00

"The first time was painful. I remember crying but i think it was more of a “poor me” feeling than anything else for having this issue. I pushed through and now have social freedom since I don’t have to shave after work before going out with friends or going on a date. Also, I can wake up and not have unsightly stubble. This helps for my mental health. I feel less “defective” each morning and in a better headspace to have a great day.  After the first couple times I don’t register any pain anymore.   Super curly might be good since they may lift away from the skin a bit and catch in the epilator easier. Definitely recommend the brush attachment.

"Yeah I think we would have better treatment options if the cause of PCOS was known, since then the treatment could maybe target the actual source of the problem directly.  I asked about the eye condition because I’ve had what I think is recurring episcleritis on and off for the past few months. Haven’t had it checked out because it’s normally one of those things where you just get told “it’ll go away on its own, but you can get some eye drops if your eyes are too irritated.” But when it keeps coming back it can be a symptom of underlying disease, so that’s a fun possibility.

"I haven’t found anything yet that helps with that. My fricken skin changes with my cycle. Early in the month it gets dry and flaky and so I need more moisturizer. Closer to my period it gets oily af. It looks like I’m all sweaty and gross at those times. I have to use these paper things or cheap thin facial tissues to pat it clean during the day.   I do eat meat, but I also eat an awful lot of fish through the month (tuna, tilapia, salmon, cod). I love canned salmon too (bones and all). I was actually told by a doctor once to lessen my intake and be careful with fish oil supplements.

"I've been on the pill for 13 years now and haven't had any major problems with it. I did gain some weight when I first started it, but I was 12 and in the middle of puberty so I think most of that weight gain was going to happen anyway.   I've been on several different combination pills at this point. I've had some with worse side effects than others, but switching to a different pill has always solved the problem. One pill made me more moody during my period (irritable, not anxious). On another I was super exhausted during my period, to the point where I couldn't function normally. I've always been able to go to my doctor, tell them my issues with whatever pill I'm on, and they've been able to help me find a new hormone combination that works well to regulate my cycle and doesn't have any noticeable side effects. It may just take a little trial and error to find the right hormone dose that works best for you.  And birth control is my main treatment for PCOS, I don't take any other meds. I wasn't diagnosed until this past fall, but my new doctor saw no reason for me to come off the birth control or add other medications if I'm doing well. My period is regular (which is why I went on the pill in the first place), my facial hair is lighter/thinner, and my acne is more controlled. For me, it seems to be a good treatment for my PCOS symptoms. Some day I would like to come off of it and see if my periods can be regular on their own, but currently I have no desire to become pregnant so it makes sense to stay on it for now.",/r/PCOS/comments/fc3jh9/good_experiences_with_birth_control/fj8uw1o/,comment,2020-03-01 21:21:22-07:00

I also have a toddler on a regular schedule, so meals are always planned and it's easy to stay on schedule doing a regular dinner at the same time everyday.

My hormones were not checked beyond regular check ups for my thyroid and physicals, but I went from having completely irregular 50 to 115 day cycles to regular 32 day cycles, so not sure how hormones would be negatively affected.

(I'm 5'4, so still obese)  I went from 206 to 160 the second time, losing baby weight which I did without IF because I was breastfeeding from 206 to 190, and then with IF lost the rest of the weight. (Overweight at pregnancy)   This has been the only way for me to manageably lose weight and not feel like I'm dieting or obsessing over food.

Eating paleo really helped me to stop gaining weight. I also did the whole 30. It was a great experience and I’ve pretty much kept this lifestyle for 3.5 years now.  Intermittent fasting has helped me to slowly lose weight. I do 16 hours of fasting (includes sleeping time) and eat during an 8 hour window. It’s pretty easy once you work your way up to it. I’ve failed losing weight doing many other diets/CICO etc. The long break from food helps stabilize insulin and the weight slowly comes off. My scale no longer swings up and down manically.

"Sorry to jump on this conversation here, but I have had both electrolysis and laser in the past and can answer your questions:  Electrolysis is done one hair follicle at a time, so it’s a very concentrated pain and generally is tender/sore for a little while after (like 1/2 hour or so).  I’d describe it as sharp kinda like getting snapped with a rubber band, but again on a really small concentrated spot each time.  I only got waxed once but it was a flipping nightmare compared to electrolysis.  If you’ve ever been tattooed, you’ve put up with a lot worse:)",/r/PCOS/comments/fbvl64/how_do_you_control_your_facial_hair/fj8f15q/,comment,2020-03-01 18:18:06-07:00
"I’ve been getting electrolysis for 8 months and it has changed my life. It is rather painful, but in my eyes, no pain no gain! It is not long lasting, it’s kind of a burning, prick feeling sensation while the probe is in then she plucks the hair out- then the pain is gone for that area until she starts the next hair etc. When the procedure is done the area is tender but not sore. I also do get down there waxed without any issue so maybe I just have a high pain tolerance. Honestly though, electrolysis has been a game changer for me and worth every penny. The upper lip is definitely excruciatingly painful (my lady uses a dentist grade numbing gel under my lip but it is still painful).

"Not gonna lie, I've given up getting rid of the hair and have started bleaching it. I shaved my hair everyday &amp; plucked and I always got nasty razor bumps and acne inflammation with stubble by the end of the day. I'm still pretty far from anyway near normal hormone levels so I started letting the hair grow out and bleaching it mega blonde. An added plus is that the longer it grows the softer it gets plus the bleach softens it more. I'll still shave/pluck when I feel its getting too long but I think for the most part I've learned to be OK with the hair (even if I don't like it) while I work on balancing my hormones to help minimize the hair growth.

"Regarding the **supremacy** of carbohydrates for weight loss, you can read this:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2693519/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2693519/)  With regard to body composition, all the 3 weight loss groups have obtained very similar results despite markedly different protein intakes. This is another example illustrating the concept that carbs and proteins can substitute for each other.  With CVD biomarkers we see the expected changes. Note that the high carb diet was only 55% carb and 30% fat. Very few studies dare to test the very low fat diets.  The study on PCOS has similar results. The loss of lean mass wasn't worse than usual but they had to increase protein to 24% to **compensate** for the missing carbs.  You should also note their BHB levels in the blood were barely elevated at all. This is because for serious ketosis you need more than 70% fat. But if fat intake is very high then protein intake can't be high and you can't keep lean mass. You see you can't **sicken** yourself with serious ketosis and keep lean mass at the same time.  And sure enough these carb deficient diets had an unusual and unnatural variety of plants in them, let's just list all the herbal extracts they were getting:  &gt;Durvillea antarctica, black radish, mint, liquorice, artichoke, horsetail, burdock, dandelion, rhubarb, gentian, lemon balm, chinaroot, juniper, spear grass, elder, fucus, anise, parsley, bearberry, horehound, Horsetail, asparagus, birch, cypress, couch grass, corn, dandelion, grape, fennel, elder, rosehip, anise, Eleuthero, eurycoma longifolia, ginseng, corn, miura puama, grape, guaranà, arabic coffee, ginger, Linum usitatissimum L., Gelidium amansii, Rheum officinalis L., Cynara scolymus L., Matricaria chamomilla L., Gentiana lutea L., Mentha piperita L., Pimpinella anisum L., Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Raphanus sativus L., Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Althaea officinalis L., Melissa officinalis L., Juniperus communis L.

"I didn’t ask for a perfect study? I asked for a valid study. A sample size of 14 women with no control makes the entire study invalid to even look at.    I don’t hate keto- if keto works for you then it works for you, but it’s not some holy grail diet, if it was there wouldn’t be other diets that people have magnitudes of success on.  If you don’t know how to do proper research you should not be recommending things based on “research” it’s actually harmful.  This study has been posted here numerous times and numerous times the top comment picks at the study because guess what? It’s not really valid. Why would you ever take advice based on a sample size of FOURTEEN women??? Especially when there’s no control factor to it.   At the end of the day certain diets work for certain people and one single diet will never be the answer for everyone with PCOS. If it works for you then I don’t care at all, that’s actually pretty great, but use valid studies and valid research when you’re trying to advise masses of people.  Like it might sound harsh but it’s honestly just true and I shouldn’t really even have to sugarcoat that.  So many people do this and it just makes me think why are we not taught how to do proper research (as a science major) all throughout life because it’s super important to specially when I see things like this. And then it annoys me more that anytime there’s a study on PCOS it’s usually a joke because even the people conducting them forget basic things sometimes.   Like there’s a lot of valid studies out there don’t get me wrong but there’s also so many studies that are a complete joke, like this one.

"what I did that finally made someone take my seriously is I laid out all of my symptoms and if they don’t take you not regularly getting your period seriously, there is something wrong because this is a serious health concern. anyway, lay out all the symptoms and say you believe you have PCOS and from my experience, they should do a CMP (complete metabolic panel) which is a panel of a shit load of tests that will help answer some questions.. MAYBE. the problem with diagnosing PCOS for physicians is that it is extremely heterogenous, and for example i had no abnormalities in my panel. but at least it ruled out any issue with my thyroid. clinically, there isn’t much for physicians to do for PCOS unfortunately. you can go the birth control route and potentially spironolactone if you’re presenting with the male pattern features (excess hair, acne, etc) or metformin if weight and blood sugar is a problem. all will help with symptoms but not address the root cause.",/r/PCOS/comments/fbldoh/pcos/fj6zcl5/,comment,2020-03-01 10:21:04-07:00

My 1st OBGYN I had at 15 (went to her until last year) never did further testing for my absent periods and just put me on the pill.

"I’ve had this tested and didn’t end up having it, which was kind of disappointing actually. PCOS is a diagnosis of exclusion so a doctor should only tell you that you have it after they’ve ruled out all the other known possibilities, like NCAH, that can produce the same symptoms. If anyone hasn’t had a 17-OHP test but has been told they have PCOS, they need to ask for one. NCAH is less likely than PCOS but that’s no excuse for doctors to skip the test.  I would’ve rather had NCAH because at least doctors know the exact cause is an enzyme deficiency. PCOS doesn’t have a known cause - it might not even be just one condition, it could be a few different, related ones that produce similar symptoms, especially because we don’t all have the same symptoms.  I get frustrated being told I have PCOS when I’m lean and don’t even have cysts on my ovaries. I just have oligomenorrhea and slightly elevated testosterone with maybe a pinch of hirsutism and acne. But technically I fit 2/3 of the criteria for PCOS so that’s enough to say I have it. The criteria are stupid, imo, and the condition needs a name change if it’s just going to be an umbrella term for a cluster of symptoms. PCOS just means “We don’t fully know the cause so we’ll just treat your symptoms based on whether you want to get pregnant or not.”",/r/PCOS/comments/fbokq8/doc_ordered_a_blood_test_for_nonclassical/fj6ocxo/,comment,2020-03-01 08:30:56-07:00

However I have had a ridiculous number of unrelated medicines, and in my experience slow release medications *usually* have far fewer and less severe side effects than their immediate release counterparts. Sometimes the difference is so noticeable that it feels like a completely different product! If your doctor prescribed you the slow release version in response to you raising issues with the immediate release’s side effects, I would be inclined to believe that your doctor believes that this will be a more suitable medication for you. Unfortunately with medicine, there is an awful lot of “try it and see”, and there is not yet a suitable and available alternative to this.

"Cushing’s, thyroid disease,  Prolactin excess, Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and there’s a couple others that my reproductive endocrinologists told me about but I just don’t remember the names of.   Basically it’s just really important that you are not diagnosing yourself or a doctor should not be diagnosing you without proper bloodwork  to rule out other conditions.   That’s usually why PCOS takes a long time to be diagnosed- it’s a process of elimination and the term PCOS is kinda wrong. Coming directly from my two leading reproductive endocrinologists- PCOS should be renamed to metabolic reproductive  Syndrome  because having Polycystic ovaries isn’t required for PCOS and it isn’t enough to diagnose you with PCOS, you gotta meet 2/3 criteria. Also 70% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance. I would read up on this &lt;-  They said a few years ago they tried to change the name but couldn’t pick a name so they’re still in the process lol.  The 3 criteria are irregular periods/ failure to ovulate, Hyperandrogenism (aka excess male hormones. This can sometimes be visible. Alopecia, Acanthosis nigricans, and hirsutism, and lastly  Polycystic ovaries.  Polycystic ovaries can only be proven/disproven by a vaginal ultrasound to see the inside of your ovaries, if you’re a Virgin I believe they do a different method.  And while excess make hormones may be visible sometimes, you need a proper blood test to confirm it’s really that and nothing else that’s out of wack.  We’re usually right on this sub when we think we have PCOS because we’ve usually done a lot of research and probably not gone to the doctor with our concerns or are going to the wrong type of doctor or they just have had bad experiences with doctors- so a lot of us try and self diagnose a condition we may or may not have- but it’s always best to just get it checked because we’re **not** doctors and at the end of the day a good doctor knows volumes more than us and can help us figure it all out.",/r/PCOS/comments/fal2y0/i_think_i_may_have_pcos_what_are_my_options/fj6dmyf/,comment,2020-03-01 06:13:02-07:00

It’s also important to mention that the diet used wasn’t a keto diet, but a manipulated diet focusing on fat / carb ratios being held to a certain degree, while also using elements of a Mediterranean diet to keep things balanced. They introduced certain vegetables into the diet that were unlimited, which may also have swayed their results.   This study had NO control measure, meaning there wasn’t a secondary group of women who made no changes, or a group of women who followed something like a vegetarian diet, to compare results with.

How long it will last will really depend on how quickly your hair grows in, but it should last at least a week or two, if not more.  I rarely had an issue with prickly hair, only if it was a particularly coarse follicle that started to regrow. When it grows in it is typically super fine.

"This is a very unpopular opinion in this sub but you don’t always have to do keto or low carb. It just really depends on the person. I say try it and see how it goes after two-three months, (to anyone wondering) if it isn’t working for you at least you can say you tried. Just make sure you’re eating a balanced diet and not consuming too many calories really.   Keto made me miserable.

I’ve lost 60 pounds in the last year just by counting calories, which I know doesn’t work for everyone.  But specifically for you- being vegetarian really shouldn’t raise your carbs up that much unless you’re consuming a lot of simple carbs / processed food in replacement of meat.  I actually fell into that trap when I went vegetarian for a year. I ended up gaining weight because while I wasn’t eating meat I was consuming a lot more bread, pasta and rice and ironically not enough vegetables. I was also consuming too much fruit (beware of this. It’s pretty easy to eat well over what you should be in fruit.)  Also there’s ton of ways to get in your protein while vegan or vegetarian.

"Definitely is- my older sister has been diagnosed with PCOS since she was 21.

"While you may have family history you still have to meet 2 of 3 criteria to  be diagnosed with PCOS. The three are: irregular periods, Polycystic ovaries, and hyperandrogenism.  Two of these criteria you can’t confirm without a doctor really.  While some symptoms may be visible(Acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, alopecia)..  without a proper blood test you don’t know what the exact cause is. It *could* very well be something else disguising as PCOS symptoms.  If your insurance covers a GP it should also cover a reproductive endocrinologist(might need to co pay). I have pretty shitty anthem blue cross / blue shield insurance and my co pay is only $30-$60. If you can’t afford to see a doctor you should possibly look into Medicaid if you’re in the US... especially since you’re required to have some type of insurance once you’re 18 even if you’re just on your parents insurance  or  on Medicaid.   As for the birth control I never said you were wrong, just that I’ve simply never heard it.  Which it does make sense but without me looking at any of those studies on birth control, I wouldn’t know.   But again if you have family history of *medically diagnosed* PCOS in your immediate family (a sister, or mother, possibly even an aunt) you have a much higher chance of having PCOS than the average woman.   For the sake of your own health you have to have it medically diagnosed. It’s extremely harmful to self-diagnose and that’s probably not what you want to hear.   And to touch back to the OB. Most OB’s are not knowledgeable enough about PCOS, which is why one of the #1 recommendations for people who suspect they might have PCOS is to see a reproductive endocrinologist. They almost always know more and often specialize in that.   If you really do have PCOS (I’m not doubting what you think) then you’re going to want to be seen by a doctor to make a plan for your health. PCOS is not curable and can get very bad overtime if left untreated and could have many negative consequences you do not want.  PCOS symptoms can lesson or even be comfortably managed but much like type 2 diabetes it never REALLY goes away.  You see many success stories on r/keto about reversing type 2 diabetes, even on r/vegan sometimes but you will always be predisposed if you pick up an unhealthy lifestyle or a lifestyle that causes inflammation.   And many women on this sub (myself included) have a fear of doctors not understanding us or  we feel that we’re not listened to or taken seriously like doctors all the time and sometimes people go through a lot of bad doctors and take years to be diagnosed sometimes  because certain demographics or doctor’s just aren’t as well educated as others and some doctors honestly just suck but they’re there to help you and they usually more knowledge (but not always!)   It took me 7 years to get diagnosed. Which is definitely something you don’t want to hear at all I bet- but I was 12 when my idiot OB told me “well I can tell by oooking at you that you probably have PCOS but i don’t do testing for that unless you’re 18. Come back to me when you’re 18 and we’ll see what I can do.”  I went home and I cried.  I went to two other OB’s and they wouldn’t even listen to anything I had to say without writing it off as normal teenage hormones (when I definitely knew it wasn’t normal.)   I self diagnosed myself at the age of 12 because a mother figure to me had PCOS and she would often vent to me about it and it all sounded pretty similar to what I had and then a year later I found out my sister has PCOS. I self diagnosed myself and never got it treated medically. I read articles online and thought that I could manage it all on my own but it turns out I also had other medical conditions affecting it that I had no idea about And it was just not sustainable for me to treat myself with Berberine, spearmint tea, and myo &amp; d-chiro supplements.  The only reason it took me 7 years to get diagnosed was because I self diagnosed myself and never went. While I was right (and you very may well be right as well) I jeopardized my health severely and I’m now dealing with those consequences I mentioned earlier that you do not want to deal with. Not everyone’s PCOS is the same and not everyone experiences it with the same severity and not everyone has other medical issues BUT some do which it is VERY important to get a medical diagnosis to confirm scientifically what you know to be true. It only benefits you in the end!  There’s only three outcomes to it-  1. you have classic PCOS and no  other health problems, and you and your medical professional(s) create a plan moving forward to help you manage it. You potentially benefit from at home remedies vs medicated pills.  2. You have PCOS but you **also** have  other medical conditions that simply aren’t that visible and you may need actual medications to manage your symptoms instead of the at home remedies.  3. You don’t have PCOS and it was another disorder that mocks classic PCOS symptoms (there’s actually a few which is why any good doctor is going to want to see your ovaries and your bloodwork to confirm.  The fact that there are 3 different outcomes should make you want to have your mind finally at peace knowing that you have what you always thought you had and nothing more hopefully, or even finding out you don’t have it  and it’s something else that’s less serve maybe.  I don’t comment often except when people think self diagnosing is enough, because it so harmful. I’m not bashing your or anything but PCOS is a serious condition you can’t just leave undiagnosed and untreated.   Even my TWO reproductive endocrinologists couldn’t diagnose without the bloodwork even after seeing my ovaries. They both agreed I have every classic symptom of PCOS and I do in fact have Polycystic ovaries and were confident the bloodwork would reflect that- but they would NOT diagnose me until that said bloodwork came back because turns out it could have been Cushing’s, thyroid disease, it could have very well just have been my weight + hirsutism, Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,  Prolactin excess, and a few other things I don’t even remember the names of.   You obviously don’t have to listen to me but you can honestly only benefit from finally getting that question answered by getting a medical diagnosis.

"One note on biotin, it can cause false negatives for cardiac enzymes. (If you have a heart attack, taking biotin can make it appear your lab results are fine.) If you have heart disease risk factors, it would be a good idea to check with your doc about taking it.

"I'm the lean type and if I wear baggy clothes to hide my tummy (which i almost always do), people don't suspect I have PCOS at all. But of course my parents and people close to me, and of course my parents told literally every single relative apparently, so that's where most of this crazy is coming from. Plus, I do have mild acne, and people just think I'm lazy about skincare.   If I can't eat this or that, and I tell that to one of these people when they are pushing me, there's a 50% chance of them forgetting I can't because of PCOS, but also a 50% chance of them linking my eating habits to PCOS in some entirely ridiculous and irrelevant way like with fried chicken and tofu comments.

"Welcome to nutrition with PCOS!   Don’t get overwhelmed with the ins and outs of specific diets. Even since posting this, I have changed mine up somewhat. With bread and rice, I would caution against the simple carb count. So I would recommend brown rice- there are also some PCOS advocates that love wild rice but I haven’t tried it. I personally avoid bread, but my carb intake is usually complex carbs and/or from natural carbs (such as vegetables). Again, don’t let it overwhelm you. Learn one thing about YOUR diet at a time, and focus on that change. Once you feel confident in that, add something else.   With B8/Inositol-   Quality is important. I am on one that personally I am not 100% sold on so I’m searching myself. EveryPCOSbody recommends Ovasitol. They have a discount code for it. Those ladies know their stuff, so I have my eyes on that next with some research and the discount code they offer with it (which I found on their instagram). It’s unlikely that you will find B8 in stores and if you do, I can’t say the quality of the product is guaranteed.

"I would recommend looking up your specific questions for progesterone to make sure you get your answers.   At the beginning of our cycles (marked by the beginning of our periods), the hormone we typically have the most of is estrogen. When ovulation happens, it triggers a switch and we produce progesterone for the last half of our cycles. Progesterone treatments are common for PCOS patients (something I am even looking into myself) if you find a good doctor that sees the importance in it. Low progesterone sometimes can point to whether or not you’re ovulating, or if you’re just simply not producing it.   From a fertility perspective, it can also cause miscarriages or pregnancy/conception complications. Many doctors have seen success in pregnancy, conception, etc. just by adding progesterone therapy. Birth control contains synthetic progestin, not to be confused with progesterone. This progestin keeps us from ovulating (one of the ways it works). There also are many negative issues with it that, in my opinion, we don’t get informed of very well. I will let you look up the effects of progestin on the female body to make your own decision on how you feel about that.   From a weight loss perspective, the first part of our cycles are the most productive. That is when we are most coordinated with exercises, and we are most likely to lose weight. Because of progesterone, we are unlikely to have much progress on the second half of our cycle- it’s going to be mostly damage control and making sure you don’t overeat.

"Augh. The rice thing. I lived in China for two years and blew up like a balloon from all of the rice. I dropped about ten pounds very quickly upon cutting it down.

More sudden weight gains It took me telling them I couldn’t do communal cooking anymore because it made it too difficult for me to eat right when every meal was based around white rice... a sad day because the house is not as integrated anymore. But everything surrounded white rice, despite my best efforts. What’s worse is that one of my roommates was a nutritionist and seemed to cook more rice and potatoes!

"I'm so sorry you're in so much pain, but it sounds like you've overcome an incredible amount of terrible things and you're a strong person who can handle this too. PCOS is hell 💜   If you're not already seeing one (and are able) I highly recommend seeing an endocrinologist about where your hormones are at. Bleeding with no cramps for me meant that I had stopped ovulating because I had gotten very heavy and my insulin resistance was insane so if you're looking to get pregnant taking care of that is a must.   *But* if you can't get in to see a specialist I will say that what has been most effective for me--more so than any combination of medicine doctors have put me on--are some lifestyle changes. They're not fun changes, and most people tell me they're not willing to make them because they sound miserable but compared to being trapped in an out-of-control PCOS situation I'll take having some extra dietary restrictions hands-down! And now that I'm used to it I even prefer it this way, probably because I feel so much better.   So, what has worked for me for the last three years is a combination of a ketogenic diet (or just low carb, ~100g or less per day, which my current endo prescribes to all her PCOS patients) and intermittent fasting. Both of those things increase your insulin sensitivity, which modern research is showing is at the heart of PCOS. So for me, this means my acne cleared up, my hair grew back, I've been able to lose weight (I'm down 65lbs from my heaviest with another 40 ish to go), my periods come without birth control (though I still have too much fat for them to be perfectly regular periods), I can feel myself ovulating again, and most recently my facial hair has started growing in less aggressively. So I recommend to anyone I meet who has PCOS and feels like they don't know what to do to try those things. Plus, they're both free so you can try them for a month or two and if they don't work out you've really only wasted some time.",/r/PCOS/comments/fb9yzp/a_million_complications_of_pcosand_miserable/fj36gg6/,comment,2020-02-29 02:48:35-07:00

"When I was essentially vegan I was relying on legumes for protein, so eating 2-3 servings of those a day (including tofu). All the fiber really upset my GI tract and caused a lot of bloating and pain. I would have mock meat products as well, but those can be calorie dense and are often still soy based (nothing wrong with soy, just adding to the legume/fiber problem)  I also was eating a lot of pasta and breads, and the calories can add up fast with those  I think that my bigger problem wasn't necessarily overeating super unhealthy things, but undereating healthy fats and proteins. I would have to eat really large portions of my carb-heavy meals to feel satiated, and that lead to too many calories. I would be physically stuffed for a few hours, but then because I wasn't eating a balanced diet I would be hungry a few hours later and eat another huge meal.   I do think it's possible to eat a macro- and micro-nutrient balanced vegetarian (or vegan) diet, but it is more difficult and requires planning. Quite honestly I currently don't have the time or mental energy that it takes to do that, so eating meat is the better option for me right now. And I feel so much better that I really don't know if I'll ever be fully vegetarian again. I would like to reduce my meat consumption some, I usually have meat, fish, or eggs twice a day right now.

"I was a vegetarian for five years, with periods of veganism in there as well. During that time I gained most of my excess weight. I fell to the pseudoscience in that community that ""if it's plant-based, you can eat as much as you want and not gain weight!"" So. Many. Lies. I've lost a few lbs since starting to eat meat again. Not as much as I would like, but I haven't been watching calories very closely so I'm sure that's why. But honestly, I feel a lot better eating meat again. I didn't realize how bloated and gross I felt from all the carbs and fiber - there definitely is such a thing as too much fiber! And I've found with the weight I have lost, it's been easier than it has in the past - I'm not as hungry and don't have as many cravings or energy crashes like I used to. My current schedule doesn't allow for consistent meal times - while vegetarian I would be so hangry if I ate lunch late. Now I'll be hungry, sure, but not so cranky or tired.   I don't love cooking meat, it really grossed me out for awhile, but that has gotten a lot better. When I first started eating meat again I didn't cook it myself - I would get some when eating out or buy pre-cooked things at the store. When I did start cooking it myself, I started out with easy things that are mostly hands-off so I barely had to touch the raw meat, like baked chicken or fish.

"OLD COMMENT THREAD FROM PREVIOUS POST:  another user asked: Wondering if you could share a little more information on how this information will be used? Is this independent, looking to develop an app, or have some IRB info from a university you could share?  my response: Yes, of course! This information/survey process is part of the primary stages of an app that’s being developed to try to help people with PCOS manage their health and condition in a way that would be sustainable long-term and lead to suitable (best possible) outcomes when trying to conceive. I am currently a student at Duke University and struggle with PCOS myself and believe that tools to help manage conditions like this (endometriosis, other hormonal conditions, etc.) that affect long term health, fertility, mental health, etc. would be really useful. I have noticed that currently the main options are to just see a doctor/gynecologist repeatedly/consistently (which is what I do to manage my PCOS and hold myself accountable), but that has been really difficult given my ever-changing schedule and demanding workload at school. I think that this app that I am working on could alleviate a lot of the problems, issues, concerns, and stresses that come with a PCOS (or similar) diagnosis. I know that an app like this would be useful for me. However, we are at the stages of trying to full understand the ways in which this could be used and how to make it the most effective and useful tool.

Hence, we would love the chance to talk to people and understand their concerns and preferences to shape this process. I hope that helps. Please let me know if you have anymore questions; I’m happy to answer them over email as well.  Another aspect that this app is attempting to address as well is simply managing the symptoms. Obviously, for whatever reason, many people with conditions such as PCOS may not interested in their fertility at this time or ever and this app’s ultimate goal is to provide them with the help and support they need to be able to manage their symptoms and health in a way that is personalized and catered to their needs, goals, preferences, etc. One of those aspects may be fertility; but, I should emphasize that the goal is not simply improving fertility outcomes. In that regard, I am simply looking for anyone with PCOS or a hormonal condition who would be willing to discuss their journey and process!

Hey I’m so so so sorry you’re going through this and it truly does suck.   I am from a decent that naturally have excessive hair and PCOS for me just piles on that. But what helped me was getting on spiro. It didn’t stop the hair growth but made it less stubbly and course and more just light wisps that aren’t a pain to shave. I still have crazy hairy legs but i havent been on spiro that long so who knows maybe it will help that too!  I would really try to talk to your gp or endo about it.

"I'm so sorry for your losses.   I've had two missed miscarriages, 8 weeks carried to 3 months and 6 weeks removed at 3 months. Due to the circumstances surrounding the first one, it's not something I've truly gotten over.   My daughter was conceived 4 months after my second loss. I was on metformin during ttc and the first trimester as well as 5 anti-emetics. Progesterone was on the low side but they never informed me or addressed it, I found out by looking at my chart. It's likely that low progesterone caused my other losses.   I read a study that said in some women, conceiving within 3 months of a loss can increase the chance of a successful pregnancy by about a third, so we started trying again as soon as I was cleared because I was going to stop putting myself through the pain and get a cat. 4 months later, I got a cat and two days later a positive on a test.",/r/PCOS/comments/fazi2p/i_lost_my_baby/fj22iex/,comment,2020-02-28 16:36:33-07:00

"I am sorry for your loss. I was diagnosed back in 2013. Wetriedgetting pregnant on our own and it didnt happen. I talked to the doctor,  was put on Clomid and Progesterone and we were able to get pregnant. I did everything I could to ensure I was being responsible. I stopped drinking soda, added more vegetables and fruit to my diet, cut out processed foods and sugars. I was getting weekly blood work and found we had an issue with my numbers dropping. I ended up miscarrying 15 weeks in. My husband and I were heart broken and devistate! We were terrified to try again and have to suffer the loss again but eventually did the treatments again, bi weekly blood work for 10 weeks and weekly blood work until we were 15 weeks pregnant. We were able to go full term and have a healthy baby boy. My mom said I was lucky to only experience one miscarriage because her grandma had 17 miscarriages before she had my moms father. It still hurts regardless of how early or late you lose your little one and it still hurts after you have children.

I kept telling her my symptoms and she just kept asking me if I wanted birth control like wtf and I think its because I'm not yet 18 and she just assumed I wanted a reason to get birth control without my mom knowing (???) because she kept alluding to being sexually active. I was so over it she just pushed her agenda and left after calling all my symptoms normal. She made me get bloodwork for vitamin stuff so maybe it'll be relevant but I guess all I can do right now is wait EDIT: I'm not sexually active and I kept telling her but whatever,/r/PCOS/comments/fa59k5/finally_going_to_the_doctor/fj1x2f1/,comment,2020-02-28 15:42:12-07:00

"Im devastated for you dear. I’m so sorry. I lost mine around the same time, but I didn’t know I had PCOS, and although I begged doctors to test my hormones they told me that the protocol was not to run tests until you’ve had more than one MC. My relationship ended, 6 months went by, I suddenly got adult acne, anxiety attacks, insomnia, and late periods so I went to the doctor and found out then— wish I’d have been given the chance to know sooner. I’m terrified of it happening again, but I’m single right now anyhow. Every time I hear a woman say it happened to her it breaks my heart all over again. Someone mentioned progesterone and I would look into that because my theory is that it isn’t high estrogen or testosterone that’s the main culprit of our problems, but a lack of producing progesterone.

"I have had the most success with reversing my PCOS symptoms by following the Whole30 diet for 30 days to heal my gut. Then, after that, I stick to the Paleo diet, but still try to really limit natural sugars. It's a lot of work at first, but it's gets so much easier after you get used to it/in the groove of knowing what is compliant. I've felt the best I've ever felt since sticking to this diet.   The book ""It Starts with Food"" by Dallas and Melissa Hartwig explains the science behind the diet (I haven't personally read it, but family members have and said it was good.) If you need some recipes to get going, I highly recommend ""The Whole30 Cookbook"" and the ""Against All Grain"" cookbook series.    In addition to diet, I've also had a lot of success with supplementing based on my specific PCOS needs.

"So far what I'm finding is that they ate about 1,600 calories a day heavy in leafy green veggies zucchini cruciferous cucumbers and eggplants. They were limited to 120 grams of meat or 20 grams of fish or two eggs per day, however they were supplemented with a high-protein low-carb liquid drink as well as herbal medicine used to offset the side effects of ketosis. So the liquid drink was made up of soy, pea and oat proteins (18g protein/3.5g carbs). They also took vitamins. The chart that they listed shows that they were taking in 20 grams of carbs, 132 grams of fat, and a hundred grams of protein which is about 1.23 grams per kilogram of body weight.

"Why don't you think you'll live very long? A lot of people with PCOS also have depression. I don't want to make assumptions but if that's the case for you, getting support for that would make managing other symptoms easier.  You should be able to find a doctor who will prescribe spiro to reduce androgens. I believe that's one medication that a lot of trans women get.

"Sometimes being under weight, specifically low body fat, can make your period disappear. You mentioned working out 6x a week, that might be putting too much stress and releasing too much of the stress hormone cortisol. Which can also make periods disappear.   Another thing with calorie restricting-make sure you are getting enough healthy fats in your diet. Nuts, avocados, monounsaturated fats and oils.

"Can relate, I have days when getting out of bed is too much and I actually have to call in sick to work. But I have also moments when I'm running around the apartment like a little girl (not literly lol). But for me it changes pretty quickly. For example, Monday morning I can feel horrible not be able to get out of Bed, but by the time it's evening I already feel a bit better, then Tuesday I feel good, and then Wednesday I can totally feel like shit again. And I am actually in the beginning stages of getting some mental help (I have my intake in about a month). And I have only been diagnosed with pcos for a month or so. But still I do indeed sometimes wonder of the part it plays. Especially when I get irritated/ angry. I have moments I can get super angry over the smallest things, which really feels out of proportion. Like sometimes I honestly can't handle it when my cat meows, I mean he does have a very sad meow, and it ticks me off like; no you're not sad, not at all, don't be such a pussy. (Pun intended hihi). And I know it sound horrible, and it makes me feel like such a bad catmom, which makes me feel more down again, and it can send me into this whole self loathing spiral. All because me cat meows and I lose my shit. So it does really make me wonder about pcos and my hormone levels. After I got diagnosed I made a follow up appointment with me doctor, and asked for my hormone levels to also be tested. But he said that it wasn't necessary/ a waste of money, because it didn't matter what the test said, they couldn't do anything to change it.

"Just a side note here, I think your terms might be a little skewed. I only say this so when you advocate for care you will be taken seriously. If you’d like, I’ve explained some differences that hopefully you’ll find helpful!!   So using a descriptor like hypomania is probably more where you’re at (could be a personality disorder or extreme hormone induced mood swings) but this looks like more energy, insomnia, impulsivity, creativity, fast talking etc. Full blown mania often requires hospitalization, as a person is far more likely to be reckless, violent, lash out, display erratic behavior etc. Sometimes people may not remember what they did while manic. Further, severe mania may also be accompanied by hallucinations and delusions. For example, someone may think they have superpowers while manic (not always). Be cautious using “mania” as a descriptor unless it truly fits, as there’s still a lot of stigma around mental health care, unfortunately.   Then on the flip side of that coin are depressive episodes. Again, these can be caused by hormones, a personality disorder, or sometimes people may cycle with the seasons (Seasonal Affective Disorder- that’s what I have). This would be the fatigue/sleeping too much, lack of appetite, lack of motivation etc. People with Bipolar Disorder may also experience suicidal thoughts or attempts that seem “out of the blue” or out of character. With other kinds of depressive episodes, there’s *usually* more build up.   As far as Bipolar Disorder is concerned, people have varying cycles of hypomania or mania, and then significant depressive episodes. They can cycle through rapidly, or over long periods of time. This is sometimes impacted by environment, but not always. The “timeframe” for this cycling is unique to each individual.   For hormone shifts, I’d pay attention and record when you notice your feelings shift one way or another. Keep a record, so you aren’t misdiagnosed, and you can bring the data to your doctor to back up hormonal causation (or you may discover it isn’t related to PCOS).   Either way, I think it’s great you brought this up, as I know many women get misdiagnosed, called “emotional” or their periods are blamed when it’s something else...and/or their mental health is blamed when it’s actually hormonal.   I hope I don’t come across as a know-it-all, I just know how hard it can be to successfully advocate for ourselves, especially with PCOS, and you’d be surprised (or not) how many docs have misinformation about both mental health and hormone health. I just want you to have all the info so you can kick ass when/ if you need to!",/r/PCOS/comments/fanq4p/manicmania/fizst85/,comment,2020-02-28 00:01:02-07:00

"I’m so sorry the ultrasound hurt. It hurt me too. I’m glad you got through it. You can have pcos without having any cysts. So you may have it. I hope you don’t though.   If you do, you’re likely insulin resistant. Almost every with pcos is. They can run blood tests to find out. Ask them too, if they haven’t. You can be  fit and have it.  Ive been vegan 20 years and was veg for 10 before that, so I totally get the challenge of losing carbs. Start slow by upping your protein. I use silk protein milk for my coffee and smoothies. Ripple is another good option. I add pea protein powder to my smoothies, soups, etc. It’s inexpensive, has no carbs or calories, and a very mild lightly salty flavor. So easy to disguise. Up your healthy fats too. It’ll help you to feel fuller. (You don’t have to go as drastic as keto.) keep a good journal and/or use cronometer do u can get a feel for what foods work for you.   The most important thing to do, in terms of your meals, is to reduced starch and sugar. Pcos is an endocrine disorder so those foods screw with out hormones. Everyone with pcos is different. I can’t eat any starch — no grains, baked goods, bread, beans, potatoes, etc. Maybe you can. Tracking your food intake and getting familiar with what foods are low glycemic (these are best for pcos) and what foods make your symptoms worse, will help you figure out how you need to eat. Same with sugar. I can’t eat any processed food, sweets, or fruit other than berries (blueberries, blackberries, raspberries are the lowest glycemic). But maybe you can have more sugar. So take your time figuring it out and making adjustments as needed.   And go see an endocrinologist. You need a gynecologist, an endocrinologist, and a dietician who knows about pcos.

"I used to work a dermatology office and we had women come in all the time (at least once a week, sometimes more) with cystic acne that started after they got Mirena, even if they had never had acne in their life. If you're at all prone to acne, or maybe even if not, it could get pretty bad.   I'm also curious, why do you think Mirena will not cause the constant bleeding that a copper IUD did? The hormones may help, but if the copper one caused bleeding from the uterine lining irritation, wouldn't a hormonal IUD do the same thing? I may be completely off base here, this is complete speculation on my part.  I don't want to be super negative, but these are the concerns that I would have if I were in your situation. And if my PCOS were being managed fairly well without hormones, I personally wouldn't want to introduce them into the mix.

I don’t like the feeling of being high but it’s made me sleep better and it helps with my libido too. Overall though, I’ve been eating better, being more active, hydrating, not letting stress and anxiety overwhelm me regarding things out of my control, and I stopped taking anti-anxiety meds and hormonal birth control because they were making me feel nuts.

"I have struggled with having a low libido. It was completely non-existent while I was on birth control, and did improve when I stopped taking any hormonal BC. What works for me now though, and I know this won't work for everyone, and it's not readily available to all, but cannabis truly helps bring my libido back to a normal level. I'm not sure if it's because it relaxes me, or why this works, but it does. Certain strains in particular seem to really work.  I have also noticed fluctuations in my hormone and libido levels depending on where I'm at in my cycle. Right after my period, my libido kicks into high gear, I try to have lots of sex during that time.

"OP - I feel like I could have written this post myself.   I ignored so many symptoms until it all became too obvious. It had been nearly a year since my last period and there were months in between periods about two years before that (I'm 30 years old). I made assumptions about how I would be treated by medical professionals (told to just go away and lose weight, my concerns being dismissed, etc).   Trust me, once you get past the waiting for results its like a massive weight gets lifted.   I was incredibly lucky that I had a doctor that responded so well to my symptoms and took action very quickly (I was actually displaying some signs of ovarian cancer so that freaked them out a bit). That being said there has still been weeks in between getting appointments for blood tests and an ultrasound. I had a couple days of pretty intense anxiety before my ultrasound so I leaned on friends and family a bit to calm me down. They made good points that I was in good hands with my doctor and that they were taking me seriously.   I got into an ultrasound within a week through a cancellation appointment (I'm in the UK and ultrasound waits can be up to 6 weeks unless they think it's urgent which in my case they really wanted to rule out cancer). At my ultrasound they were able to tell me that they couldn't see any abnormal growths which was really encouraging to them but that the results would go to my doctor along with blood tests results and they could hopefully tell me more after that. As much as I didn't have any answers after the scan it was a huge relief to be reassured that it wasn't the worst case scenario.   From there it was onto the blood test. They did pretty broad testing on me (again, checking for both hormonal issues and signs of cancer). Once I got to the follow up appointment (yesterday actually) the doctor went through my results, explained what the different hormones were trying to do and what they indicate. It wasn't still glaringly obvious that it's PCOS but it's the most likely thing at this point. Slightly elevated LH and high testosterone. I've been referred to a gynaecologist now and I have one more blood test in two weeks to check my hormones again.   I hope you get some answers and have a supportive doctor.

"For me it was terrible anxiety that started around the 4th grade. Then inflammatory issues, then my first period at 13, which was horrible and heavy. I was breaking out and developing physically three years before my first period. Then I’d go months without one and it would come on hard and fast without any warning with so much pain I’d miss a week of school.   It wasn’t until I started walking 5 miles 5 days a week (2.5 to and from school) and got into kickboxing and dance that I started getting better cycles.   I was 16 when I had a large break of not being really active and the issues started up again. First my anxiety, then inflammatory stuff and weight gain, then massive breakouts, then cycle issues.    It’s been like this every time for me when anxiety takes the reins. I try not to let it, but it just sneaks up on me (reaction to legit massive bs) and I have no idea until the symptoms worsen.

Since you’re already regulating your insulin very well due to keto the berberine will try to further control blood sugar. If it causes too low of a drop in blood sugar (which berberine has been shown to do in clinical trials with diabetics who already have well control insulin &amp; blood sugar) it will cause hypoglycemia (way too low blood sugar).  Here are the most common symptoms you may experience if you have hypoglycemia:  •Confusion  •heart palpitations  •**shakiness**  •**anxiety**  Notice the last 2 specifically.

"Yes. So. Much. So.   I was diagnosed when I was around 17 years old (now 23). Got married when I was 21 and started birth control as we were not about to have a baby that young. Birth control messed me up SO badly, I got severe depression, anxiety, and gained so much weight. I started birth control before we were married (we waited for marriage to have sex) and it tanked my libido so much that in the two years of me recovering from the effects of birth control I’ve never had the desire to have sex, or be able to be turned on, ever. This is due in part to my rather large weight gain while are birth control too.  It’s been a pretty significant issue in our marriage, and it sucks so so much.  So no, you are not alone. I thought I was alone too as many women with PCOS have claimed to have insane sex drives.  I’ve found that losing some weight has impacted my libido for the better, but it’s still not where it was pre-birth control.

"PCOS symptoms vastly improve when you are at a healthy weight for your frame/height and have the proper amount of body fat. Body fat, especially belly fat, influences hormones. So to fight insulin resistance from PCOS and to get your hormones balanced, you need to get to a healthy weight/body fat. It sucks and it's hard, but it's important. You can take metformin to help with hunger and in balancing your hormones, but fatloss is still critical.  Equally important is changing your diet to a PCOS diet. Meet with a dietician (and an endocrinologist) that knows about PCOS. Low carb (no starch/no sugar) is best. Try to keep your net carbs below 40g. Use cronometer to track and see if you are meeting nutrient needs.  Looks have nothing to do with it. It's about selfcare and battling PCOS. I haven't seen one PCOS recipe that's about appearance/attractiveness. I'm not sure where you're seeing these things. Look at Pinterest instead. It's more about identifying ingredients that will fit your nutrient needs, then you can create recipes with them.  I didn't find out I had PCOS until I was 39. I wish I would have know at your age. Would have made the last 20 years so much easier. Once you get used to what you need to do to take care of your illness, it'll be second hat. Once you're at a maintenance level you'll be able to have cheat days, here and there. Please don't disregard the importance of managing your illness because family members are annoying. In a couple years, you can cut those people out of your life if it's that bad, or limit contact.

But as unfeminine as being hairy can make you feel, it's important to remember that the good people in this world will see past something as natural as hair and love you for who you are beyond the physical. Those are your people. Plus, a hundred years ago women with full body hair were seen as normal and desirable - it's only when Gillette launched their ad campaign convincing women to shave that it became expected of women to be hairless.

Hormone imbalance/changes can def cause headaches. After my withdrawal bleed from the pill every month I get headaches following the period week where I’m only talking the placebo pills and the hormones from the pill are basically dumped from my body.

"You see your hair that way because of female pressures and societal expectations. We replicate what we see. So if we see people out there living their best lives because they're hairless outside of eyebrows and head, we copy. And it's a reinforced stigma and taboo in our society to conform to what society wants us to be like. You don't have to embrace it fully, but maybe start slowly. We have hair where we do for a reason, even if seems more prominent compared to other females because of PCOS.   Start small and work up. Maybe stop waxing/shaving/whatevering your legs. Winter is perfect for that, especially if you wear pants. I only shave my legs once or twice a year, and I have no problem with it. Then try other areas. I would suggest keeping your armpit hair trimmed at the very least for deodorant and to not have a BO smell. But you can be feminine and have hair. You might stick out, but I feel that we've become slightly more accepting of females with hair on them. Remember, you only have to do this for you, and you don't have to do this for anyone.

"There's a couple of things you wrote that aren't quite right. I mean, yeah, keto is trendy right now, but some of that is driven by people succeeding.  You don't need carbs for general health but OP can use fasting as a means to use keto and still eat a diet her family considers acceptable.  The key with PCOS is getting insulin down.  Ketosis from fasting or restricting carbs will do that.  &gt;(0.5kg is ideal, anything more than  that is rapid weight loss which means your body will start breaking down  muscle instead of fat cause it's easier to break down).  Your body is smarter than that!  :)  Fat is energy storage, the body will use that before muscle.  Even straight fasting for 2-3 days the body uses fat first and foremost and only small amounts of lean mass which is one reason a protein sparing fast is so effective.  That said you are spot on that a lot of people overestimate energy in and tracking for a couple of weeks can help OP get a sense of oh, I am having a lot more pasta than I thought or a lot more cheese, etc.",/r/PCOS/comments/f9rkz1/on_the_verge_of_deep_depression_and_anxiety_pls/fiw8t6u/,comment,2020-02-26 21:35:15-07:00

I totally hear your frustration asking why and PCOS is driven by high insulin.  If your family really is that negative (which has to suck for you!!) then fasting might be the best tool you have while minimizing carbs when you do eat.

"When I first brought up that I thought I had PCOS, the dr I was seeing dismissed me. A year later my symptoms significantly worsened. Had that dr listened to me, I might not have lost half my hair, etc. I wish I had been more prepared to give a lot of detail the first time I brought it up, so I made sure the second time I went to a (different) doctor about it to have a note in my phone with all of my symptoms. I also get really anxious so my note helped me remember everything I wanted to say. My brother in law is a dr and always says to make your symptoms seem like a slightly bigger deal than they are in order to convey the seriousness of what’s going on. On the one hand I hate that people have to do that, but if it helps get the correct diagnosis then it’s worth it. If you’re worried about your doctor not taking your concerns seriously, you could be prepared to say something like “please document in my chart that you aren’t going to test for PCOS.” I’ve read other people who have done this and it has changed doctors’ minds. Hopefully it doesn’t come to that though, and you can always get a second opinion.

"Thanks for these resources! The last link has a lot of great things to say. One of the comments is from a thin woman with PCOS that says she thinks of those with obesity as having, “late stage PCOS” and I wonder that there is truth to this given I’ve struggled with these symptoms my whole life and regardless of weight, though my heavier weight tends to result in worse symptoms.  It also seems to me that there are some people that never have symptoms until they’re older and have gained weight. I’m curious if PCOS can be grouped into types, like diabetes. For example, could there be a PCOS Type I that you’re really born with (or metabolic syndrome as the link points out), as well as a PCOS Type II that occurs solely from lifestyle. So maybe Type I people have it always, then develop symptoms through things like an improper diet, but people with Type II get it and can get rid of it through diet alone.  Since I’ve gotten older, more of my friends suddenly have PCOS. But I wonder how many of them actually have it versus simply having a poor diet and perhaps are more pre-diabetic than actually having PCOS.

"So I'm not sure you're aware, but breast tenderness during your luteal phase (second half of your cycle) is totally normal and expected.    That's just the effect of progesterone which is only produced post-ovulation.  It should go away shortly after your cycle restarts as your progesterone drops.  I can't say from reading this whether or not that's what you're experiencing or whether you're experiencing something abnormal.   (I don't see your age here either so I can't tell if that's related.)  Generally more nipple soreness would be good from a health perspective as it would mean you had a stronger ovulation and produced more progesterone, but combined with increased lip hair and cramping your picture isn't totally clear.  If you have been engaging in more testosterone producing diet or lifestyle factors that could explain your increased lip hair (or it could just be age).  Usually these would also have the effect of lengthening the menstrual cycle in PCOS people.  You didn't mention how regular your cycle normally is, but just as a reference point, shortening cycles (down to 28) generally indicate better metabolic health and more likely ovulation (and progesterone symptoms) and lengthening cycles (above 28) generally indicate worse and less likely ovulation and progesterone symptoms.  I would say if you're worried about any of these things (especially the breast pain, if it doesn't go away after your period), then see your doctor.",/r/PCOS/comments/fa21j3/noticing_changes_and_its_not_pleasant/fivv33p/,comment,2020-02-26 18:58:42-07:00

Plus I also had a CT scan done of my adrenal glands when I went through the diagnostic process the first time to make sure I didn’t have tumors or growths causing my hormone imbalances. The CT scan saw cysts then.,/r/PCOS/comments/fa48wc/what_will_an_ultrasound_tell_me/fivukwq/,comment,2020-02-26 18:53:21-07:00

"Almost any county hospital or clinic will accept medicaid (i.e. Harris County Public Hospital) or look up ""free and income based clinics"". If you have not had a routine well-women's exam for the year, medicaid should pay 100% for a preventative exam (don't quote me on that because I've never had medicaid)  You also just go on zoodoc, enter your insurance and see what providers accept that insurance.  But if you go to a private practice OB/GYN place, you will be paying for a self-pay visit which will be about $200 like you said. If you want the cheapest labs, ask for the order yourself so that you can go to.a free standing lab (Quest, LabCorp, Any Lab Test Now, etc...) rather than doing the labs in-house which probably cost more.  \-Houston based medical provider",/r/PCOS/comments/fa1c1v/insurance_for_pcos/fivtup1/,comment,2020-02-26 18:45:32-07:00

"We are born with the predisposition but lifestyle factors can absolutely worsen or bring on symptoms. I personally didn’t experience any symptoms until my diet got out of control and I gained a ton of weight, and my symptoms are kept under control now through dietary changes. This is a common story here and on other PCOS related forums. Hyperinsulinemia is what stimulates the ovaries to overproduce testosterone, and unfortunately the quickest ways to increase insulin levels are sugar and carbs, weight gain, and being sedentary. Lifestyle plays a huge part.

"25-31% BF is healthy for women.  Maybe you looked at the males chart by mistake.  It is high for a BMI of 16, which is definitely underweight, but in and of itself, it is a healthy amount of body fat.  So as long as you gained equal amounts of fat and muscle, you'd still be healthy.  As for the rest, PCOS is tough, because everyone has different symptoms.  My sister is healthy weight, probably a 20 BMI and has PCOS.    Without having your hormones tested, it is unclear what might be going on.  I would recommend making an appointment with both an endocrinologist and a dietitian.  Being that far underweight can be as bad for your health as being morbidly obese.  You need to put some weight on, but you need to do it in a healthy manner.  The most probable reason for your loss of periods is not the PCOS, but rather how far underweight you are.  Menstruation is typically one of the first things your body gives up on when it is not getting the necessary nutrients.  If you do have PCOS, that could be a factor, but you won't know until you get to a healthy body mass and body fat.    For the rest of your questions, I don't know.  Good questions to ask the endocrinologist.",/r/PCOS/comments/fa3d1f/severely_underweight_high_bf_pcos_is_it_possible/fivpphm/,comment,2020-02-26 18:01:55-07:00

"I came to say this. At my most recent ultrasound, I had a sheet over my legs, he put the wand down by my feet, I grabbed it under the blanket and inserted it myself. The handle was long enough that his hand was between my knees and only my knees and he never looked or touched anything besides my knee and leg. It was extremely private and not at all like a Pap smear. I wasn’t on display and I didn’t feel uncomfortable. There was an assistant in the room to chat with as well and she stood by my head and they said she was there because it’s policy (meaning as a witness that nothing bad happened) and she made me feel relaxed as well.   I’m sure I could have asked for a female tech —- don’t know if that will help you or not, but they should absolutely accommodate whatever you need, including the above. They do have to touch the wand handle and move it around but it’s not painful and like I said, I was the only one who was anywhere close to my vagina.

"I get it. I'm a rape survivor and I have vaginismus. When I went for my ultrasound I was panicked. So I had my husband drive me so that I could take two valiums beforehand. Ask your doctor for some valium for the procedure. You won't fall asleep but it will make your muscles relax so that you don't freeze up and it will ease your anxiety and prevent a panic attack.  Make sure that the ultrasound will be performed by a woman and no men will be there. FYI -- it's almost always a woman anyway.  When you arrive, tell the tech that you are a survivor (you don't have to get specific) and that you are scared. They are used to working with survivors and are kind people who want you to be comfortable. The Tech will give you the option of inserting the wand yourself. If it makes you feel more comfortable, do it. If they don't offer, just ask. Give yourself permission to get up and walk out at any point if you are uncomfortable/triggered. Give yourself permission to say ""stop"", ""no"", and ""remove it"". Tell the Tech ahead of time that you may need to suddenly stop and remove it/have her remove it. They will understand and be compassionate. They do this all day and they know how invasive it is and a large percentage of girls/women have been victimized sadly, so it's not going to be uncommon for them.  I put in earbuds and watched a Disney movie on my phone to distract me until it was over. Consider something like that too. The whole thing lasted 6 minutes. It was very fast and gentle.

"the metformin only really helps with weight issues. the birth control is what protects from the cancer because they really don't want you to have too much unopposed estrogen. but at that point it's do you want to live without side effects now,  versus more likely having risk in your 50's or 60's.

"I've had a similar thing going on.  I'm 42 years old and have been on birth control since I was 16 and on continuous use birth control for a long time, maybe 20 years.  For the first few years of that, I took a week off every 3 months, but my doctor told me that wasn't necessary, so I stopped. I went probably 15 years without ever having a period, which was perfectly fine with me.    Then, around 3 years ago, I went on Metformin and Levothyroxine and 2 years ago, I started working to lose weight.  After losing about 60ish pounds, I started having a period, despite still being on the same BC I'd been on for years (I use Xulane, which is a skin patch).  That period lasted 5 weeks.  After 3 weeks, I went to see the doctor to make sure it wasn't cancer or a ruptured cyst or something, had a transvaginal ultrasound, everything was normal (not even any cysts).  I had to take iron supplements due to the bleeding, but otherwise, it was just annoying. It stopped after 5 weeks.  I then went months with nothing, but then started lightly bleeding, just enough that I had to wear a liner.  That went on for like 10 weeks, but very light, and not every day.  I haven't bled for about 2 months again now.  Through all of this, I've remained on BC, as it was the only thing I could find that controlled my debilitating migraines and I'm not willing to take the risk going off of it.  So you're not alone.  My only advice is to take iron supplements if you bleed heavily for more than a week.  They can cause constipation, so make sure to eat enough fiber, too.

"&gt;Well, the data does tell another story. You're in USA? You can check incidence of diseases in 19th century and the 20th century. In 19th century everyone was living off white bread and table sugar and they didn't have the modern diseases (except tooth decay). These diseases started in 20th century when middle class started living off meat and dairy.  the consumption of sugar has skyrocketed since the introduction of HFCS. soda wasn't a thing in the 19th century and people cooked with lard because vegetable-based equivalents hadn't been invented yet. nobody ate boneless skinless chicken breast, they ate meat with fat. they didn't snack between meals. there were no ""low fat"" versions of foods. fruits and vegetables were not available year round.   consumption of fatty meat and saturated fat more broadly has gone down while obesity and diabetes have skyrocketed. other factors have changed as well... industrial seed oils are a brand new product that people eat a *lot* of, now.   our diet looks nothing like what people used to eat in many ways, so there's not much of a point in comparing them. I'm only interested in comparing how I eat now and how I feel now with how I used to eat. I dont particularly care how my ancestors ate.  &gt;Anyone who tells you carbs cause insulin resistance is clearly a liar.

Why don't you tell for how long you've been eaten this way? It's easy to eat like an Eskimo for a month or two, it's another problem to live off like that for decades.

It sounds very intriguing. I’ll look up where i can snag it! Thanks for that. I am a part of a TTC group on Facebook and always see their posts about the test strips and temp tracking but its all so overwhelming and i honestly never have any clue what to reach for first. Maybe that book can guide me some?  Definitely would like to see the reproductive endocrinologist, my OB mostly follows up these days verbally. We dont even do blood work as much anymore. “With PCOS things don’t usually change” is all i would get when id ask if we should maybe check me out!  We had this conversation yesterday actually. Its scary to think of how complicated it can get. I expect it can be quite pricey too but were thinking big picture. I have intensely searched for doctors who have an interest in PCOS in my area because im scared to end up in a place that generalizes me with regular women and fails to help me. Thank you so much for the information! Im starting to lose fear to try every time i feel closer to understanding the process.   Congratulations ♥️!

"I would HIGHLY recommend reading 'Taking Charge of Your Fertility'. I read it after I went to nursing school and I couldn't believe how much I didn't know about the female reproductive system. It literally covers everything you need to know to figure out if you're ovulating, how to improve your chances of ovulating and improve your chances of conception. It's literally a gold mine. And temperature tracking is amazing. I use a basal body thermometer and I take mine vaginally because I'm a mouth breather. It sounds weird and overwhelming but honestly the amount of information I get from it is incredible.   I would also recommend starting with a reproductive endocrinologist over a normal OBGYN. It can be expensive, but it's so worth it to get a doctor that knows what they're doing. For example there's new research that shows that overweight women with PCOS respond better to femara then clomid and femara has less side effects. My OBGYN just wanted me to take clomid and 'see what happens' but I got a second opinion from an REI doctor and was pregnant two months later. He had me take femara and do temp racking with LH strips to confirm ovulation. It seemed like a lot at the time, but he knew what he was doing and I was able to get pregnant without going through years of trying. When you have a PCOS diagnosis it's actually not that hard to get pregnant for most people if the doctor knows what they're doing.",/r/PCOS/comments/f9u3us/why_is_it_so_complicated_to_do_the_one_thing_my/fitxb6o/,comment,2020-02-26 08:35:54-07:00

Consider measuring yourself with a tape measure instead of weighing yourself.  Do your midrift. Two fingers above bellybutton so you're consistent with the placement.

"It's not ketosis that causes insulin resistance, it's the animal foods and fat. It can be argued it's physiological in the sense that, if you're not eating any starchy foods and fruits, then it does more good than harm (after all, it preserves the very scarce glucose). But it's to be seen if you can be healthy in this state for long term. I don't think so. For how long you've been living in this style now? A year? Two? Three?  Beta cells do not cause insulin resistance. It's the insulin resistance combined with the high carb foods that causes beta-cells burnout.

"I don't know your situation exactly, but if you are already over 18 I would try to find your own place if your parents won't support the diet you want to follow. I know it's hard, and you're trying super hard as it is, but moving away from them would do a few positive things for you. Firstly, you would lessen the negativity around you coming from them. Secondly, taking that step away specifically to focus on your health would show even more than now that you are SERIOUS and that PCOS deserves to be acknowledged with respect, not mockery. Following your own routine, perhaps with a supportive friend/roommate who will help you stick to your guns, is so much easier to do when you live under your own roof. You are accountable for yourself, not to them. I'm not saying they aren't good people, but until you can make progress with them to understand what you are going through, I would keep them at arm's length. I would suggest, maybe before making this large of a step, getting a pamphlet about PCOS from your doctor, a nutritionist, or even just a medical journal online or at the library. If they still don't get it, they may not, which is frustratingly disappointing, but at that point...if it were me, I would make it clear, maybe in a letter (because I have anger problems with my PCOS), that you will not discuss your weight or health with them anymore because of their apparent disregard for your very real, legitimate diagnosis! If they bring it up again in a negative way, put your foot down, tell them you will not discuss it if they refuse to accept it as a real condition, and leave. You will have done enough on your end to try to help them understand, and it is not healthy to force it. It's too much stress added on top of an already stressful situation.  As far as your depression goes, I completely understand. It has taken a while for me to tackle that particular aspect of PCOS, and I have gone to psychiatrists and psychologists. Sometimes, it's as simple as removing stress from your life where you can, other times it requires help. Don't be afraid to get a professional to help you, whether behaviorally or chemically, but make sure not to withhold things from them. The mind is trickier to deal with than the body, they can't read your mind, only make educated guesses based on the information you give them, so don't hold back. You pay THEM to help YOU.  I hope this helps, but don't be afraid to reach out again if you need it.

"Hello, I'm so sorry you're going through this, I can totally understand family being hard on you to lose weight, mine are the same. I personally haven't come up with a way to deal with that and everything they say still effects me, so I hear you, and I'm sorry that you're through that.☹  But I can offer you some advise on the losing weight,  based on the *tons* of research that I've done 😂   Firstly I wouldn't necessarily go keto, it seems to be quite trendy rn but the fact is that your body needs fats, carbs, and protein for general health. What appears to be the best method is eating at a calorie deficit and exercising. A calorie deficit is consuming less calories than you would normally eat, it's best to do this and exercise.  There are apps that will take your weight, your height and how much weight you want to lose per week (0.5kg is ideal, anything more than that is rapid weight loss which means your body will start breaking down muscle instead of fat cause it's easier to break down).   With the same apps, you can start checking how many calories you're eating, you mention that you're eating healthy, that's great! Now check how many calories you're eating cause it's easy to think you're eating less than you actually are.   If you have anymore questions about it, please do ask, and I sincerely hope things improve for you.",/r/PCOS/comments/f9rkz1/on_the_verge_of_deep_depression_and_anxiety_pls/fitfur8/,comment,2020-02-26 05:03:34-07:00

I would workout at least 7 times a week, ate healthy about 85% of the time, and would only keep gaining weight. I was depressed, way too hard on myself, anxious and just not in a good place. My doctor would tell me that I just needed to work our more and eat less. It was so frustrating. I finally switched doctors and found out I have PCOS and insulin resistance, and once I started IF and metformin, I started immediately feeling better.  On 6/1/19 I was 198 lbs. This is the day I started metformin and IF. By 9/1/19, I was down to 170lbs. And today I am 156 lbs.  I don’t know if this will work for you, as everyone is different, but it might be something to discuss with your doctor.",/r/PCOS/comments/f9l2ih/just_diagnosed/fit1m2y/,comment,2020-02-26 00:04:17-07:00

"Those little compliments definitely do go a long way! Especially from a partner ❤ it sounds like you are a gorgeous soul and gorgeous souls radiate outward!  I used to have absolutely horrendous skin problems too! Constant acne breakouts, oily yet dry, loosing elasticity, scarring, blackheads, etc. I'm allergic to glycerin so my options in skin/beauty care are extremely limited. A friend made an odd suggestion... stop using soap on my face. It's drying, harsh, and a lot of the commonly used chemicals are endocrine disruptors, and we don't need any more of those! Instead I took a few washcloths that were textured for exfoliation, cut them into 4 pieces (hemmed the edges to prevent fraying), and I now use them morning and night, sometimes in between, to remove oil, dirt buildup, dead skin cells, and to freshen up my face, chest, and shoulders (I used to breakout everywhere). I had my doubts at first, but I feel surprisingly clean afterwards and my skin actually feels healthy! At night I use a mild olive oil to moisturize (just a couple dabs, you don't need much!). My friend told me her grandma swore by olive oil, used it every night, and always looked at  least 10 years younger than her daughter. Now I use it after my showers at night to moisturize my entire body. My skin has never been so happy lol I did a little test and went back to using soap.  I used it once and my skin broke out terrible for a week.  Oh and for an all natural makeup remover just use a little bit of coconut oil (organic unrefined is best) on a cotton pad or paper towel, it'll come right off without having to fight with it! If it's solid just warm it up first, either with your body temp, or if it's too cold use a toaster oven/microwave. And if you're prone to razor burn - after you shave, wash off, and dry the area apply coconut oil. It immediately soothes the skin and keeps it from getting razor burn. I don't shave unless I know I have coconut oil in the house. Safe for bikini area too, you can actually use internally as a lubricant, as well.   I also eliminated gluten, most dairy, nightshades, and other foods containing glycoalkaloids and solanine. All of these have proven to be very inflammatory to my body, including my skin. If I accidentally eat something with nightshades I will have terrible breakouts on my face and chest the next morning, guaranteed. I've learned a lot about how my body reacts to certain foods, chemicals, and products lately.   *Olive oil is antibacterial and can even fight a few types of bacteria that are unresponsive to antibiotics.   **Coconut oil is antimicrobial. It contains lauric acid and monolaurin which can kill harmful pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  ***Avocado oil is safe on skin for certain individuals. May cause sensitivity in persons with a latex allergy due to it containing similar proteins (banana, chestnut, kiwifruit, passionfruit, plum, strawberry and tomato may also cause sensitivity in certain individuals for this reason). If sensitivity occurs do not use topically.   Love and light on your own health journey!! ❤",/r/PCOS/comments/f9guhh/one_compliment_goes_a_long_way/fiswemf/,comment,2020-02-25 22:35:58-07:00

"Some doctors are assholes who can't take a suggestion. Considering how common PCOS is that's the only real explanation for the delay in testing.   If one of the clients at our clinic says they think they're anemic or has strep we test for it because it makes them feel listened to and a lot of times they're right.

Thank you for sharing! We all have moments when all you see is negativity but not everyone manages to speak up about it. I never even discussed anxiety and depression with my doctor because i was afraid to. I’ve made it my mission to focus on bettering myself in all aspects and that has greatly impacted my mental health. I rarely have those “what’s the point” moments anymore. Ive slowly built the courage to be more assertive with my doctor to get the help I need. Ive never seen a specialist and as hard as it is to find the right doctors im stressing over how ill find the right specialist but im willing to make it happen!  Hold on to hope even when you’re completely stripped of it! Best of luck to you on your journey. I will gladly have talks to help our mental state!

I completely know where you’re coming from. I’ve dealt with this myself. It takes a lot from you to think about it so often. To make matters worse when a symptom remotely related to pregnancy comes up all i can do is remind myself i cant assume anything because its not very likely. My husband and I really want to actually try this time around and have considered seeing a specialist but i cant find it in me to go get really checked out. Do i really want that affirmative no it will likely never happen or do i want to cling on to that hope? I dealt with quite a bit of anxiety and depression over the years since being diagnosed so i know its hard to find the right person to vent to. Believe me i know you start to feel like you may be obsessed with the topic but dont be so hard on yourself. Some self love goes a long way. It’s something you will have to learn to live with your entire life so the best thing we can do is find ways to release all those pent up emotions.

Also if your tiredness etc continues then I recommend going to the doctor and getting an iron level blood test.

"What worked for me - No alcohol (or vodka soda like only).  - Avoid sugar at all costs.  - Check out the Candida diet - Focus on leafy greens and overload if you want  - Blender Bombs/Veggie smoothies - Limit dairy and gluten  Just basically eat Whole Foods and protein as much as possible and avoid overloading on sugar and fruit.   STRESS is also a huge factor. I’ve noticed I switched paths at work and my skin is doing much better.   Skincare: Skinceuticals retinol, CeraVe moisturizing cleanser, and CLEAN makeup products (download ThinkDirty) app.   After three months of this I am ovulating regularly, weight is down, and skin is clear.

"I'm a 20 year vegan. I've lost 42lbs in 5 months on 30-35g net carbs/day. I started at around 70g net carbs/day.  For PCOS, stick to low glycemic veggies (mostly greens) and your fruit should be sparing. Stick to blueberries, blackberries or raspberries.  Get some healthy fats from whole food sources so you are getting lots of nutrients and feel fuller -- olives, avocados, sunflower seeds, tahini, peanut butter, and pecans. Soups and smoothies will also help you feel fuller.  For protein sources, add pea protein powder to smoothies and soups. Lightlife Ground and Burgers, Beyond Beef, and Impossible burger are high protein, low carb and high fat. You'll feel nice and full on those. Also, nutritional yeast is 8g protein for only 1 1/2 tblsp and adds a cheesy flavor.  Lower your carbs gradually. That will help you to have less cravings. I stopped having cravings three months in.

"I don't trust male doctors. I have literally never had a good one. The ones I’ve had don’t listen to me or take me seriously. I had a male doctor look at my knee (I’ve had trouble with it since I was a child) in December because there wasn’t an option for a female one. He immediately infantilized me (“you’re a teacher, so you’re smart, so I’m going to explain to you what’s wrong with you”), and completely dismissed my pain and concerns. I left the office crying.

"Yeah There's a slight risk of increased clots, especially if you already have a clotting disease 🤦. Most ""pill related clots"" happen in women with clotting diseases. I had a clot. The pill was blamed. But when my father had a clot, 'genetics'.  Did your family doctor test you for clotting diseases or recommend you get up and walk around every few hours? If not, they haven't done their jib properly. I believe that the reason the pill causes clots is because women are ignored, but if you go into emergency with clot symptoms and are on the pill, you're more likely to have a test to see if you have a clot. Data selection bias. Diane 35ED is only for PCOS nowadays and not general contraception because of the belief that it causes clots.",/r/PCOS/comments/f9bxkn/vindication_my_doctor_has_begrudgingly_confirmed/fis0j4s/,comment,2020-02-25 16:56:55-07:00
"1) I do not calorie count, but if you have a tendency to overeat you should keep an eye on it. you can still eat too much on low carb. if weight loss is your goal shoot for a deficit. intermittent fasting makes it easier.  2) you need to count net carbs, not total. this is total minus fiber. so a vegetable with 20g of carbs and 18g of fiber per serving only has 2g of net carbs. as long as you avoid really starchy stuff like potatoes and corn you should be able to eat plenty of veggies without going over 100g of net carbs because most veggies have a lot of fiber.  3) I lost weight when I was eating around this range but it had no impact on my symptoms. some women do have success at 100g, it's all very individual.  4) 20-30g  5) metformin, but my symptoms did not resolve even with it until j got down to the aforementioned range.",/r/PCOS/comments/f9jr7r/advice_with_starting_vegetarian_low_carb/fis0du9/,comment,2020-02-25 16:55:19-07:00

"low carb and no sugar will definitely help, but you should start by tracking what macros you eat normally as a baseline. spend a week eating like you usually would but log everything into carb manager. then when you begin to reduce target a certain amount. you don't have to track every day, but start off tracking so you develop an intuitive sense of what that amount feels like. I recommend starting with 100g/day and reducing as needed.  I say this because *many* people start a ""low carb diet"" where they dont track and don't have any idea of how many (if any) fewer carbs they are eating. often it turns out theyve hardly reduced it at all. then they get frustrated with their lack of progress and announce that it doesn't work.",/r/PCOS/comments/f9ig2k/i_have_had_pcos_since_i_was_16_now_im_32_and_i/firzf1t/,comment,2020-02-25 16:44:57-07:00

"You probably gained muscle and lost fat. Muscle is more dense than fat — muscle takes up less space than fat for the same weight. That’s great, and the goal of many fitness programs!   Edit: If you’d still like to track progress, you could consider using physical measurements, or having your body fat percentage measured. However, that could lead to obsessing over it — probably best to go by how fit you feel and feel that you look!

"I'm still currently going through this process, for me however I don't have cysts but have every other PCOS symptom, my doctor even said I have PCOS but wouldn't get me to get tests so after complaining a lot I'm gonna go to a gyno and check my blood end of march.      I'm glad that you didn't quit! For people with PCOS it is SO hard to actually get the doctor to give you the tests! My derm suspected I had it, went to the gyno has no cysts but even she mentioned I could have it as you only need 2 out of 3 criteria and not all PCOS women have cysts, but then my doctor never mentioned it again until I went there for my scalp irritation and she noticed I lost 3/4th of my hair and I said I've had it for 6 years, so she realized it seems I do have PCOS but all she did was give a pill. It is ridiculous how doctor think testing is unneeded or just ASSUME that it will come back normal.   I'm glad you mentioned the hormonal IUD! Also very weird to me that you seem to have proof that you have irregular periods, also have hairloss balding (me too), which are 2 out of the 3 signs of PCOS, and they still wouldn't send you to have an echo to check for cysts, and even if you had no cysts, they should immediately check hormones, as PCOS only required 2 out of 3 criterias which you would all have if you had hormonal imbalances it would be the criteria of male pattern hairloss/body hair growth/acne area, irregular periods is the other sign, and cysts the last. How in the world they could say you definitely are balding, have irregular periods, think you have PCOS and still push it off? Ridiculous!!     EITHER WAY YOU GOT THE SCAN YAY! CONGRATS &lt;3 :D doctors like this need to learn from these experiences, the doctor who said shes sure I have pcos said hormonal tests are useless when I asked about it, and the other doctor said that the only criteria she knows for PCOS is cysts and just smiled rudely in my face as if I can't have it because of that, and said she never heard of hormone testing for PCOS (a hormonal imbalance condition). Luckily I pushed her and said I'm sure it is, and she looked it up and is letting me get tested. Sadly we gotta keep pushing for the tests even when they also have suspicions. So I'm glad you made this doctor learn from their mistakes! Some doctors really need women with PCOS to come rock their world and show them that it is not as ''rare'' as they think and it needs MORE ATTENTION.

"Not me, but my sister recently had a large ovarian cyst removed. The biggest thing for her afterwards was the swelling/bloating from the surgery.

Yep! These are my temple area regrowth pics from a while ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/891lsu/low_carb_regrowth/  My density has since returned but obviously it was easier to snap a pic when there was such a stark difference. I lost 100 lbs total but in all honesty that alone did nothing for my hair loss. It wasn’t until I went low carb after I hit my goal weight that I saw these significant improvements and the shedding finally ceased.

"Low carb definitely helped me lose weight, but it was very unsustainable for me (it would probably be easier if I didnt live with my mom who eats pasta and rice on the daily). I couldnt stick with it for more than 3 weeks, but in the course of those 3 weeks I lost 25 pounds. (But gained most of it back as soon as I stopped)  Spearmint tea has completely cleared up my acne in less than a month!! I've heard it helps with hirsutism as well, and I think it may have helped? Still the same amount of hair, but it's very very thin now. (I've never had a huge hair issue, it's just a little patch on my tummy so it's not a huge deal to me)   Of course I'm on birth control too, I have been since I was 14, and I'm 19 now. It's hard to really know how much it has helped me cause I've been on it for pretty much the whole time I've know about my pcos, but it didnt help my acne or me weight (2 of my biggest symptom) but I've always had my period on time, and my testosterone (and all my other hormones that I cant remember the names of) levels are in the higher end average levels, compared to my very first blood test when everything was just a wreck. I've had no negative side effects, but I rarely do when it comes to taking medication.   I also used to take magnesium supplements for a while, and I did notice they improved my mood a decent amount (I'm not sure if this is even relevant, but I know a lot of ladies with pcos suffer with depression and just feeling down, so I thought I'd mention it!)   That's all, I've still have not found anything to help with my dark skin patches, or a diet that is both effective and not miserable.

"I have some experiencing working with a pediatric endocrinology team and it’s not uncommon for girls to go through “premature adrenarchy”, where essentially the adrenal glands get turned on a bit early and starting causing the more androgen related puberty changes a few years before a child really gets into puberty (body odor, acne, oily skin and hair, body hair). This also tends to happen more often to people with a family history of pcos. It sounds like what you’re describing. The more estrogen related puberty changes still will come but a bit later (breast development, periods). If you’re concerned, I would take your daughter to your primary care doctor to discuss the concerns your having and if it’s appropriate to do further tests and maybe get a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. In the meantime, eating healthy/ maintaining healthy weight, exercise, and good hygiene (I.e. using acne face wash) can be helpful.

"I also married young. I was 19, and 7 monthsater I had my first miscarriage. When my period didn't come back for 3 months, I saw a doctor. I was pretty irregular before- usually anywhere from 6-7 weeks. That doctor told me I had PCOS, but was also really insensitive and rude. I didn't go back.  I got depressed. Well, I was already depressed, but my diagnosis made it worse. However, I started to realize through study that all of the health issues I had were because of it. I wasn’t a hypochondriac. I really was fatigued all the time, it wasn't in my head. My parents felt bad because they used to pick on me for being fat and told me I was eating too much faster food when in reality I was not.   I started eating a low-inflammation low-carb high-lean protein diet. I started taking a bunch of vitamins that my body was likely deficient in. Most importantly, I started taking inositol. I've written extensively about inositol in the past, but it really is the best over the counter supplement a woman with PCOS can buy. If you know the right sources, it's inexpensive and super helpful. It also helps with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.  What does you doctor say? I'm surprised that they haven't put you on something to kickstart your period and then given something like Clomid or Femara to help you conceive. Are you seeing a doctor?

"Hi there! While i never had a cyst that big, i’ve been to surgery to have one removed some years ago. I’m guessing the process depends on where you’re from, but i’m from Denmark so this is what i can tell; i hope it can help you.  I was having severe pains and was brought into emergency surgery to have the cyst removed. They thought it was my appendix, but found the cyst with a key hole surgery. As they tried to remove it, it burst. Nothing too dangerous for me, it just meant a little more pain due to extra fluids creating pressure around my organs.  I was sore for a week after, and they checked the cysts content for cancer (standard procedure), which was negative. Due to the burst i did need some help moving around and getting in and out of bed. I also threw up alot because of the morphine, and had to go to an additional checkup.  I have to small scars now, in next to my hip and one under my navel. They’ve faded over the years and dont bother me much anymore.   If you have ANY questions at all or just want someone chill to talk to about all this, you’re more than welcome to DM me.

"So I don't have advice to help medically, and I don't know how well this will be received... And I sincerely hope the humour can be seen in it and I don't offend anyone...   My aunt went through the same thing (she recently told me because I confided I have pcos and told her I was worried about fertility when we started trying). For her and my uncle it took them 10 years of being married to fall pregnant. In that time, there were many miscarriages, and equally as many big family functions, and being of an ethnic background, there were lots of questions about when they were having kids, some poorly timed to be within the week she had miscarried. This one aunt of hers was so persistent, one day, she lost it a little and looked her dead in the eye with the world's most serious face, and said ""I'm so sorry aunt, I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I keep swallowing but just nothing seems to happen!"" she was never questioned on it again, and has 2 wonderful kids now 😊 love them all dearly.  You're may not be in a position to be so bold as this, however I wonder if you might be able to have a conversation with your parents and in laws, and just tell them ""hey, WE are trying, things aren't exactly going OUR way, but WE'D rather not talk about it too much and WE will share with you when WE have great news"" I emphasise the we... Because this is the conversation I've had with my family. And becauee they need to know it's a combined effort. And because I feel the husbands need to be in it too so the pressure isn't always on the wife!

"I’m 38 and My husband and I got married 17 years ago. We have been “trying “ to have kids for the last ten years. It’s been a journey. We actually ended up moving away from our home town partially to get away from the pressure to start a family. It actually helped us become stronger as a couple. But for me the feelings of guilt were never to far away.   I posted a while ago about feeling like PCOS was crushing my family’s dreams. I got a lot of great advise and support from other Cysters. But what I had to decide on my own was that my ability to procreate was not and should never be what makes me a great wife, daughter or daughter in law. It’s not your responsibility to provide grand children. The other thing that helped was sitting down with my husband and really clarifying his expectations for our family ( the two of us). It surprised me to find out after so many years of marriage, that he had accepted that we might never have kids, before we got married. The day I came hone from my first appointment with the endocrinologist and let him know what we were up against was the day he came to terms with never having his own children. In his word “ I didn’t marry you because I wanted to be a dad someday. I married you because I wanted to be your husband.” I wish he and I had sat down and had that conversation years ago because it lifted so much responsibility off of me.   Now I’ve made my focus my cycle and my weight. I’ve begun tracking my LH levels and my temp not so I know when I’m fertile “if I am at all” but so I can see if my body is doing what it should. I think the shift in focus is a huge stress reliever. I worry a little that my age is creeping up there and my window to get pregnant is shrinking. But I won’t get pregnant unless I’m taking care of my body as best as I can. So I might as well do what I can to make a positive change than wallow in guilt and negativity.  I really hope you can find some peace and understanding in your family. I wish you luck.",/r/PCOS/comments/f92q6s/nobody_around_me_gets_it/fipsod5/,comment,2020-02-25 01:30:18-07:00

"Sorry but your parents and in-laws are the worst, unless they don't know that you have a disorder but I guess they do by now, after 4 years.  I am so sorry and, believe me, I know exactly how you feel and I remember crying endless nights alone because of this.  Personally I went through the same, his family was horrible, making comments about wanting grandchildren and more. He didn't really understand me, and I didn't mind about the rest honestly. My friends had babies or were pregnant but that didn't affect me, what did bother me was how they felt pitty for me and treated me with extra care when close to babies, that was annoying! So, I started a fertility treatment and after one unsuccesfull year I realized I didn't really want to be a mom (my gyn told me that it happens to lots of women, realizing they don't  really want it). I was 26 already, had been trying for a while. I postponed it and said I would try one or two years later. By then, both my husband and I had realized we didn't want kids, which was good, because a few months later he cheated on me with a 19 yo girl and now I'm 31, divorced, travelling  the world and everyday I thank my body for not allowing me to get pregnant when I tried, at such a young age. I'm having the time of my life, for real, and I have the most amazing man by my side.  Why do I tell you this? You are still young and you never really know what will happen, and probably now you want this baby more than anything in your life, I did feel that and I did cry so much, but even though you cannot see it now, maybe it's just not the moment. And eventually, when you have your baby (or not, but maybe you accomplish amazing things!!) you will look back and realize how much you've grown and how much more ready you are, and it will still be beautiful for you ❤  I wish you the best, whether it takes long or short or forever, and hope you can focus on being happy and surrounded by people who understands you and loves you.

"Let it come naturally. You can still express concerns without it being all about PCOS. If she looks tired that evening, ask if there's anything you can do to help out or if she needs anything. You aren't going to be the magical person to fix it, and it's better to let her bring it up. But noticing the small things and trying to help out with those small thing is never a bad idea. And if in doubt, find small ways to cheer her up on the harder days. I don't think most people would say no if someone offered to take up their half of the chores or pull a little extra weight around the house. Everyone's PCOS is different, and it can affect her in different ways as she ages and when it comes to sex.   That conversation will come when it's time, and if you are ever concerned, you should express it in a healthy way. Relationships are built on trust and communication, and while you shouldn't be tiptoeing around the convo, you shouldn't be bringing it up all the time.

"I think being aware of it (as you have done) is a good thing, but it's probably best to let her drive any conversations about it or the symptoms of it.  Keep in mind that PCOS is really just the ovarian expression of metabolic syndrome, so it's kind of boring, she'll have it her entire life, and she's probably frustrated from the management she knows she will have to do life-long.  Also keep in mind: it is very common. Approximately 10% of women in the US have PCOS.  With regard to libido, it can actually have [varying effects](https://www.floliving.com/pcos-libido/). Some women experience increased libido and others experience less, and this can also change as she ages or as her hormones change due to dietary or lifestyle (or stress) changes.     As someone who is a little older (35) I have had about 20 years of symptoms and changes now and I think the only really important thing would be to keep in mind that good metabolic health drives reduced symptom expression.  Healthy low-carb eating is key to avoiding complications like diabetes and all of the side-effects that come from that.  There are a lot of early side-effects of high blood sugars (carpal tunnel, Bell's palsy, skin problems, morning nausea, constant fatigue, etc) that can show up in your late 20s and you do not want those symptoms to progress.  This does not mean restrictive eating, but it does mean encouraging the consumption of protein and fat over carbohydrates when snacking.  In the US, we have been taught that carbohydrates are healthy and fats are unhealthy, but this is poor advice for someone with PCOS.  A proper macronutrient balance tilted away from carbohydrates (particular refined carbohydrates) will drive a proper appetite, and that will drive healthy blood sugars and weight, and minimize symptoms.",/r/PCOS/comments/f932lf/how_can_i_help_my_so_deal_with_pcos/fipa1q2/,comment,2020-02-24 20:30:51-07:00

I think if you just reassure her that it doesn’t change how you feel about her, just showing that you are willing to be there if she needs support will be super helpful in itself:)",/r/PCOS/comments/f932lf/how_can_i_help_my_so_deal_with_pcos/fip9gli/,comment,2020-02-24 20:24:04-07:00

Mostly goes. I get hungry around meals mostly. I treat  myself to not heart healthy fats sometimes because I fucking deserve something yummy once in a while, dude. I miss carbs so much. I've lost 3.2lbs in four days. I feel great. It's working and I hate her for it.   She gave me a special incentive by admitting that she had pcos and managed hers successfully this way. She was at a great weight and was full of energy. She also gave me some podcasts to listen to. It was the single greatest motivation I've ever experienced.

"Can’t speak to the diagnostic process for NCAH, but the glucose tolerance test is a much more sensitive test for detecting insulin resistance than using fasting glucose or A1C numbers alone. It involves fasting for 8-12 hours and drinking a bottle of pure glucose within five minutes.   There are different variations of the test depending on the doctor and whether you’re pregnant, but generally they will take your blood sugar level in your fasted state and during the 1- and 2-hour (or even 3h) mark after you consume the beverage to see how well your body metabolizes sugar. Some people get their insulin levels measured with each blood draw too, but even without insulin levels, the test can measure how fast your body brings down your glucose levels.

"Some men get it, I am fairly confident MOST men get it, actually. After I found out I had PCOS, it got easier to get guys to relate. I have lots of guy friends, and my SO has been with me nearly 15 years, accepting the weight, the facial hair, the thinning hair, the mood swings, and the insane periods. The friends just ask basic questions about symptoms and at least two or three have seen me looking/acting less than my best.   It's gross, but let me share 2 times my SO rose above and beyond all expectations, beyond even going to the store for comfort food and feminine products.  We were on a road trip, coming back from a lake that was about 2 hours away from home. I knew my period was starting, had tried to prepare for such an eventuality, but even with all the extra measures we had taken I was bleeding severely and we were driving back from rural areas with no convenience stores. It got so bad that I bled through my tampon, pad, and pants, and it was starting to get on the towel we had placed on my seat. I started crying and apologizing, but he just pulled over, grabbed a beach towel from the back, and shielded me with the car door and the towel so I could try to change out what I could and put the rest in a bag so we could throw it away later. He kept reassuring me that it was ok, he didn't mind it, and when we got home he would go to the store for me and get all the standard goodies and requests for me so I could lie down with a heating pad after a shower.  The most embarassing moment was after I had just started on hormone treatments. In the middle of the night, I woke up and knew I had to make a mad dash to the bathroom. I rolled out of bed and got some blood on it, and when I stood up...I literally bled down my legs and onto the floor (thank goodness it wasn't carpeted) and immediately started crying and panicking. He woke up, figured out what happened, calmed me down, grabbed a towel for me so I could make it to the bathroom without worrying about the blood continuing to come out, and while I showered he cleaned up the crime scene in the bedroom and even grabbed the towel in the bathroom and started laundry so it wouldn't stain!  I asked him what, if anything, really bothers him about PCOS. He said almost nothing, but he gets a little agitated about the unpredictable periods when it is detrimental to our sex life. Some of the mood swings, when they get really bad, are hard to navigate through, but he's very non-confrontational and patient, waiting for the inevitable moment when I stop acting like a hard-headed maniac and want a long hug and kiss on the forehead.  Don't get me wrong, he isn't perfect in every way, but no one is. It's just, when it comes to medical issues we have no control over, he gets it. He's a keeper, for sure, and he's definitely not the only guy in the world who understands, so don't give up on men when there are ones who are SO worth it!",/r/PCOS/comments/f8q9og/its_funny_men/fioffhn/,comment,2020-02-24 15:10:11-07:00

If the sensation is persistent I would insist on being seen earlier. I've never heard of PCOS causing that and black spotting could be an intestinal bleed. I don't want to alarm you any more than necessary but I think you get checked out immediately. Your period being out of sync isn't all that surprising since pregnancy and birth wreaks havoc on your hormone levels (and if you're breast feeding it could still be affected even 9 months later) but the other two symptoms worry me.

Trust me, you will not ask this question anymore if it's as painful as mine was, and from the research I did it seems my experience was common.

Scans showed I have one more cyst on each ovary currently, hopefully they just go away like others have in the past.

"I just mentioned my symptoms, and my gyno said ""sounds like you might have PCOS, let's do a blood test"" and that was that. I'd definitely lead off by saying you have some concerns about your symptoms, and let them know what symptoms you're having and how long you've had them. If they're not willing to test for whatever reason, I'd recommend seeing an endocrinologist (it is a hormone disorder after all) because there are quite a few ways PCOS can manifest, and you're not likely to get every single major symptom at once. For example I have the weight in my  abdomen, insulin resistance, and hirsutism, but I don't really struggle with acne.

I imagine it also impacts my PCOS, but endocrine disruptors are kinda slow moving when it comes to removing them (the damage is typically already done &amp; not easy to remove).  The easiest ways to avoid them is to attempt no/low waste living- many refillable containers are made without the BPA linings and that's a huge contributor of the endocrine disruptors in richer countries, along with purchasing packaged items that say 'BPA Free'. Aside from that, research common endocrine disruptors that exist in soaps, lotions, other body care products and then find new products without those chemicals in them.

"I think about it. In high school, I was hoping to be a college athlete and was told I wouldn't make it if I didnt lose weight. I was diagnosed with bulimia because I did weight training, regular practice, running/conditioning, and travel ball practice and it took almost 2 years to lose 40 pounds. I for the life of me could not get under 215. I was anemic and barely fit into a Large.  I lost my scholarship when I broke my foot  so I took another adventure. But first, I got lap band. I worked at Disney as a CP and walked all damn day. I still couldn't get under 215. Finally, I went to college, depression hit, and I went up to 230. Then graduated, had a desk job and went up to 250. Lost hair, my chin hairs went crazy, and my boobs finally came in. Then, got married at 265. Then had my lap band taken out due to complications. And my husband left me because I hit 300 and we didnt have a baby within 6 months of trying.  My docs never thought I had PCOS because my periods weren't bad. Until I got off of birth control and things went crazy.  Thankfully, I have a very kind Gyn who gets it. And we are going to try to work on better eating habits. But she told me as long as I can lose 5 pounds every 2 months then I'll be doing well.  I'm just mad at the time and the science.

" I was misdiagnosed with Von Willebrand’s Disease (a clotting disorder) based on my PCOS symptoms at the age of 14.  The misdiagnosis affected many of my life decisions because of the  risk that injury carries for those who actually have the disorder.  It took my husband and I exploring whether having kids was even safe for me before we were referred to a hematologist who ended up ruling out the blood disorder completely.  That was four years ago...  once Von Willebrand’s got ruled out, there didn’t seem to be any concern over figuring out why I had my period for four months straight when I was 14.  It wasn’t until I finally came off birth control and started TTC that PCOS was discussed as a possibility.  And this was only after I advocated for myself by pressuring my obgyn to figure out the root cause of my continued period issues.   I have some frustration over walking around for 15 years with the wrong diagnosis and for some of the “safer” decisions that I made because of being incorrectly diagnosed.  Honestly though, Getting my PCOS diagnosis has been a god-send.  The more I research, the more I feel connected to others.  Having a blood disorder that no doctors have heard of, that I was constantly having to explain to people, etc. was very isolating.  Now I have a community of people who can relate to what I’m going through.  For that, I can’t be too upset about my past.  Instead, I’m focusing on what I can do to make the next of my situation moving forward.  I feel the best I’ve felt in years and it’s all because I finally know what I have and how to move forward working to treat my symptoms.",/r/PCOS/comments/f8jxu6/is_anybody_angry_about_lost_time_due_to_pcos/fin9o18/,comment,2020-02-24 08:42:30-07:00

"We are born with the predisposition but it is true that our dietary choices and weight can impact how severely our symptoms manifest. I saw that as good news though because it meant that lifestyle changes might reverse some of the issues I was having when I was obese and had high circulating insulin levels. Going low carb was the best thing I’ve ever done for my PCOS because it lowered my insulin levels which ended up lowering my testosterone and nearly all of my previous symptoms resolved. You don’t have to starve or exercise until you’re exhausted, small changes can really add up over time!

"Healthy Male (21) here, I took Finasteride for around 6 to 9 months, it worked great, no side effects, except a slightly decreased Libido, but not a concern and worth the benefits.  I swapped doctors, and had to go for a checkup just as routine. They caught hypertension, really high blood pressure 193/90, normal range is around 120/80. I felt 100% fine but it was considered an emegency, they did a bunch of tests, found my liver enzymes were off the charts. I went for countless blood tests, ultra scans, they didn't find anything. Eventually my doctor suggested , stop taking Finasteride just for a week or two , as that's the only thing that had changed in the last year. My blood pressure and liver values returned completely to normal within two months. I felt 100% fine throughout the entire time taking it, but the doctors were pretty concerned. Hypertension and raised liver enzymes aren't really listed as any of the side effects for the medication, so the doctor couldn't really explain it. That's been my experience, but a lot of men take it with 0 side effects, somewhere around 10% experience temporary effects. I'd still recommend to try it , but just be cautious and aware of potential side effects.",/r/PCOS/comments/f66i16/your_experience_taking_finasteride_also_known_as/fim54rh/,comment,2020-02-23 21:27:09-07:00

"When my husband and I first started dating I told him I couldn't have kids (because a doctor had told me that.... no diagnosis,  no explanation... just a ""you have too much testosterone.   You probably can't have kids, but other than that you're fine""), but didn't explain (or know) details.  It wasn't until we were married and settling down that he said ""I've always been cool with the fact that you can't have kids.... but, let's at least find out more about why.""    I say all that because it was BECAUSE of my husband that I went and sought a formal diagnosis.    The fertility issues are what he, and most people, understand most about it.... and I've openly talked about my frustration with other symptoms.   But, none of this happened when we first dated.  None of this is an explanation for behavior.    My point....  In an open honest relationship the conversation comes up when the conversation comes up.

"Having insulin resistant pcos is not dependent on if you are lean or not.  Individually you would need to be tested.    I’m a normal to recently slightly overweight and insulin resistant PCOS so you can be a healthy weight and have it.  I think that if an individual is overweight or obese with PCOS then not only is having the insulin resistant type of pcos a concern but being pre-diabetic is a concern because of weight.   Basically, it’s possible to have overlapping health problems.  The treatment for insulin resistant caused by pcos or by being overweight is still generally the same.  You can improve your glucose levels and insulin sensitivity by diet, exercise and medication.

My SO wasn't doing keto so trying to deal with two different dinners or side dishes was a pain.  But at around 50 or so, I could still low carb and not have issues around dinner time. I did find it helped with some of my symptoms and cycle did seem to speed up (mine are usually 35-36 days long and regular).  I did combine with IF which helped me maintain a healthy weight loss each week without doing a crazy diet that I can't maintain.  I've never been diagnosed with insulin resistance and am not sure if the tests I've had done so far can actually rule it out.  I was offered some meds to help when I was diagnosed but did the diet change first.  I was trying to get pregnant during this time (and how I found out I had PCOS).

Then give Ovasitol (or one of its generics) a shot. If those things don't work, I'd go on to the ""bigger"" things that have side effects like metformin and spironolactone.

"Hi! Same here! I think my experience could help you!  Always skinny, I've gained and loss weight really easily in short periods of time and I never had overweight, reason why it took so long for me to get diagnosed. In fact, as you mentioned, I  only got diagnosed after a year of trying to get pregnant, otherwise doctors didn't think I had anything wrong (even thought I had 17 cysts in one ovary and 14 in the other).  Long story short, I decided I didn't want to go through any fertility treatment and don't really wanna have kids anymore (I'd hate to inherit PCOS to a daughter or my migraines to either a daughter or a son) and being diagnosed finally gave me hope of getting rid of my severe cramps and PMS, the horrible extra hair (arms, inner thighs, back and neck, and this Mario moustache) and obviously the cysts. My insulin resistance test was normal, but after many months of my treatment not being effective, my doctor (god bless her) decided to try a small dose of metformin (500 mg) and it was exactly what I needed! The first 3 weeks were awful, vomiting and diarrhea, but I've been on treatment for over 2 years now and my life has changed for the better. I still have some extra hair, but now it's less and thinner, it doesn't bother at all, easy to get rid of. No more cysts, no more severe cramps and my PMS are not as bad as they used to be. So my treatment is Diane 35 contraceptives + 500 mg metformin everyday with breakfast or lunch and that's  it. You gotta give it a time to work and the dose might need to be adjusted, although in my case it worked perfect as we started.  I would totally recommend  you to insist. My doctor and I took a chance and it worked even though clinically I didn't need metformin, but my body is sure thankful to it and I feel so much better.

"there's not much science behind the mediterranean diet... it was the brainchild of ancel keys who developed it based on veerry dodgy epidemiological studies that he did in the 50's. you can look him up, he was the pusher behind ""low carb for heart health"" which has been pretty roundedly debunked. a mediterranean diet is absolutely better than the standard american diet, but the only supporting evidence for it either draws the aforementioned conclusion (it beats the SAD) or is purely epidemiological, which is to say based on people's long-term guesswork.   PCOS and the obesity that comes with it is rooted in insulin resistance and is exacerbated by carbohydrates. this is why symptoms are often especially hard to deal with for people on typically high-carb diets like vegetarian. that's not to say vegetarian can't be low carb, but with those kinds of diets low carb/high protein animal foods are replaced with high carb alternatives. low carb vegetarian can absolutely be done, it just takes a bit more work and planning.  for more expert opinions I recommend dietdoctor.com its a great place to start",/r/PCOS/comments/f8hemc/diet_help_for_my_vegetarian_wife/file3xo/,comment,2020-02-23 16:12:05-07:00

I don't have hirsutism anymore, in the past I did and it went away with a combination of low carb and metformin. I am back to my Mediterranean level hairy self.  I used to be insulin resistant but bloodwork doesn't seem to indicate I am now.

There's global and public awareness for so many diseases and conditions affecting men AND women but for something like PCOS and hyperandrogenemia (my case) that ONLY affects biological females, we're stuck with bullshit artificial hormone medication that just masks and suppresses our natural unbalanced hormones instead of balancing them permanently. No one's even heard about it because there's not enough public funding and research. Heck, I called my hospitals research department last Friday and the worker never heard of it and she mentioned having daughters to my age.  Imagine if every single girl in the world had PCOS or androgen excess with lowered amounts of our natural feminine hormones..........men and society would go berserk because it's not natural or healthy; short term and long term.

"No, insulin resistance is definitely the most common cause of PCOS, with I think 70% of women having it. But there is also BC induced PCOS, and inflammatory PCOS (cause by gluten and dairy intolerances).   I’m in the same boat as you, trying really hard not to go on BC cause I think it messes too much with hormones (when I already have wonky hormones). And the side effects aren’t worth my time. Plus I think it’s really important to get the the root of your PCOS, and not just treat the symptoms.   There are a lot of dietary changes and supplements that you can be taking to help your body heal, but you definitely need to know what type of PCOS you have first.   I would definitely encourage you to read Period Repair Manuel. I found mine at my library and read it in a day!

"Any doctor I talk to about taking supplements or doing diets for PCOS is like, ""Sure, go ahead, try it"" because they have no idea. They can throw birth control, metformin and spironolactone at PCOS, that's about it.  Ovulation with PCOS is actually a good thing. Sure, it's probably not the goal of everyone with PCOS to ovulate, but it's a healthy sign of regular periods. Taking inositol/Ovasitol will not negate a birth control pill, though.

"to be frank: because reversing chronic diseases like PCOS requires a lot of hard work lifestyle-wise. major diet changes that can impact your social life, exercise which is uncomfortable at first, medication which can give you uncomfortable side effects especially if you don't make the aforementioned diet changes... and to add insult to injury those changes take a while to reduce symptoms and they have to be long term.  birth control is a really quick and really easy way to reduce symptoms without disrupting your life. yes, the underlying issues persist but you do not experience the symptoms of them Ina significant way in your day to day life. the vast, vast majority of patients-- and I don't say this to be disparaging, we do not live in an environment that makes it easy-- are never able to achieve significant and lasting weight loss or to permanently change their diets. the vast majority of us eventually go back to a ""normal"" (standard american diet) way of eating. this way of eating is very toxic to our endocrine systems as evidenced by the sudden and extreme rise in PCOS, hypertension, and diabetes, but it is utterly normalized in our society.",/r/PCOS/comments/f89pc3/are_estrogen_creams_dangerous/fikjq2v/,comment,2020-02-23 11:14:03-07:00
"Not 100% sure I’m understanding the situation, but it sounds like you just need to have the prescription transferred to a pharmacy where your new insurance is in network.   It sounds like when I worked for a hospital - I had to use the hospital’s doctors and pharmacies. When I got a new job, I just had the RX transferred to a retail pharm.   As long as your current RX has refills and isn’t expired, I think it should be fine. A prescription for a non scheduled drug like metformin has a 1 year expiration date, unless doc specified otherwise, which is rare, or until refills run out, whichever comes first. Filling pharmacy doesn’t matter.   All you have to do is find out what pharm is in network with new insurance, call that pharmacy and tell them you want to transfer your RX. To be most helpful for them, you’ll want to have the name and strength of the drug, the RX number assigned by the original pharm and the phone number of the pharm where it’s being transferred from. They’ll set you up with a profile with your info, have your new insurance info when you call and they will call the old pharm and get what they need to fill it. You could go do this in person if you’d fee more comfortable- some places may require it if you’re a new patient.  Hope that helps.

It did help a little bit right away but my hirustism, unexplained weight gain and depression which significantly progressed over the last year was the final tipping point to move towards IR. I would have never made the connection on my own, and was so focused on thyroid issues because they are common in my country, whereas diabetes and weight issues aren’t (skinny Eastern European country affected by Chornobyl.) Even my family was kind of shocked because I’ve always been very healthy, active and don’t present in the same way the others do. I guess I had to get worse so that other symptoms presented more prominently to figure this thing out, but also I was immensely lucky to find a doctor outside of my country on a trip who had more experience and was open to treating me based on symptoms and family history. I’d never even heard PCOS or insulin resistance was a thing, and doubtful I would have, this is extremely uncommon here, or rather rarely diagnosed.",/r/PCOS/comments/f7xc12/im_tired_constantly_and_its_ruining_my_life/fijzzv9/,comment,2020-02-23 07:47:06-07:00

As harsh as that might sound it’s the truth, all it really does is lower your insulin to help with PCOS.  Lower insulin makes it easier to lose weight when you have high/ insulin resistance.  You need to eat healthy and exercise to see the results you want, and if you’re overweight or obese you should really get the weight taken care of before trying for a baby.

"I am one of those people with bodyhair, it's been over 3 years now since I last shaved. At one point I just came to the realisation of; who am I doing this for. The answer was that it wasn't for me, so I stopped doing it. I got diagnosed with pcos only a month or so back, so it's still pretty new to me. But I'm one of the lucky ones that doesn't really have pronounced facial hair, but my upper lip hair has always been a little bit darker and I had been really conscious about that as a teen/youngadult. I even bleached it a few times. And I have to admit I don't know what I would do if I had more facial hair myself. I think first and foremost, you need to be comfortable in your own skin, so even if facial hair was trending right now, doesn't mean you would feel good rocking it. But I think if you do feel good about rocking your facial hair then you should just go for it and haters gonna be haters. Don't wait for the trend, or other people to tell you it's okay. To be honest to only reason armpit hair got 'trendy' is because more and more people started doing it and the movement just grew from there. I think it's also harder for facial hair to start trending, because a lot of women don't really have it. That said I also think a lot of people aren't even aware of pcos, I wasn't, and that it can cause excess facial hair. So a little bit more awareness for it wouldn't hurt.

"Wow, your story sounds almost exactly like mine. I was feeling like shit for about 6 months, went through a battery of tests to explore MS, cardiovascular issues, the whole gamut, since I was experiencing odd neuropathy symptoms, terrible headaches, insomnia, muscle cramping, racing heart, and fatigue to the point where it was exhausting to get out of bed and make myself a bowl of oatmeal.   I started Vitamin D (had a mild deficiency of 22 ng/mL — I specifically asked for the Vit D lab because I wanted to leave no stone unturned since my doctors had NO idea what I was suffering from). My doctor didn’t think that it was related to my issues at all, but advised me to start supplementing at 2500IU. I began steadily improving after starting the D and drastically lowering my carb intake. The carb idea came from an excellent endocrinologist I saw who told me that I could be experiencing insulin resistance, despite being a normal weight, having a norma (76) fasting blood glucose and a normal (5.3 - 5.4) a1c.    I’m so thankful to feel better.

Super common issue. I’ve dealt with it for a long time but I stopped taking birth control and don’t have that issue anymore. You need to switch pills. A doctor could give you a prescription for extra estrogen and that should stop the bleeding but it will happen over and over again until you find a pill that works for you.

"I felt the same way. I followed r/intermittentfasting for a while and thought I could never do it because I would feel so nauseated if I go too long without eating. So on a Sunday I decided to just try it since I was going to be home all day, I wanted to see how my body would react. That first day turned out fine, so I decided to try it Monday as well. And once I realized how easy it was and that I didn’t feel sick I stayed fully committed and started losing weight really fast. Before fasting my weight fluctuated a lot. I would gain and lose the same 10 pounds over and over again and I couldn’t figure out why. It would also take me a couple of weeks to lose 3 pounds only to find a week after that I’d gain 6 back. It was really frustrating. With IF my weight doesn’t fluctuate at all. I’m 20 pounds away from my goal weight and 40 pounds down and I’ve plateaued big time. I think if I start fasting 6-7 days a week rather than just 4 i will get there, but I’m trying to be gentle with myself and not become obsessed. It’s really the first time I’ve had a “lifestyle change” that didn’t feel like a crash diet. I actually LOVE fasting. I’ll never go back to eating 3 meals a day. And I think the trick to not feeling sick is to not have anything but water and sparkling water during your fasting time.

"Hey! I totally understand that freak out feeling over hair and I’m so sorry you’re going through it.  It’s super hard to say what will help without knowing what your levels are/what is driving your imbalance. Hair loss can be caused by many things including an estrogen/progesterone imbalance, a thyroid imbalance, high androgens, low vitamins, or even a combination of all these things. For example: I had hair loss from high androgens and low progesterone in comparison to my estrogen. The root cause of my PCOS was inflammation from dairy and gluten, and once I removed those, my levels started to balance out. In addition, I started taking anti androgen supplements to help my hair further. This is what worked for ME, but your hair loss could be caused by different factors. This is why it’s important to know your test results.  If you were diagnosed with insulin resistance, my advice would be to get that under control ASAP as that is the driver of a lot of women’s hormonal imbalance with PCOS.   Try to take a deep breath. You are doing all the right things by scheduling to see an endo and take control of your symptoms. You aren’t going to lose all your hair between now and that appointment, so just focus on diet and exercise for now and wait to see what the doc says. It’s going to be ok 💕",/r/PCOS/comments/f7y8y2/have_a_total_freak_out_moment_about_thinning_hair/fihgkwr/,comment,2020-02-22 15:22:14-07:00

"I'm happy for you. :) My experience was the opposite. Though I tolerated Metformin well at first  (starting at 500 mg, then gradually stepping up to 1000, then the 1500 my endocrinologist prescribed), I lost a distressing amount of hair while on a higher dosage. It was insidious so I hadn't realized so much was falling out until it had dramatically thinned. My bathroom sink and shower drains were constantly getting clogged with my hair. Our robot vacuum was suddenly entangled with long blonde hair - mine. I spent thousands - literally - on wigs and toppers. I felt alone with this but in online searches found that many other women, especially those who are younger, experienced hair loss while on Metformin. A possible theory is that it can inhibit the absorption of vitamin B12. I don't know what exactly was the underlying cause, but when I decreased the dosage my hair loss quickly lessened. Now a year after going back to the lower dosage (500 mg a day) my hair is significantly better. It's growing again.   I lost weight when I started on Metformin (8 pounds over two months, which was substantial because my BMI was 21), then gained weight (24 pounds over a year) on the higher dosage. It was causing my blood sugar levels to drop way too much, and hypoglycemia caused surges of intense hunger unlike what I'd ever experienced before. It felt like being attacked with these ravenous pangs. On the upside, while on the higher dosage my skin was flawless. I had no breakouts, my hirsutism was reduced, and overall my complexion improved. My skin has remained fine - not glowing, but rarely problematic - on the 500 mg / day.",/r/PCOS/comments/f7uxpg/just_a_coincidence_or_a_benefit_of_being_on/fihdb8o/,comment,2020-02-22 15:04:37-07:00

"I think you listed two different goals which might interfere with each other depending on how bad your cortisol/stress response is right now.

"A normal ovary is about the size and shape of an almond, while a PC ovary is typically about twice that size. So it is unlikely that any distention in the belly is caused by ovary size. That being said, because of the hormonal imbalances, we tend to hold weight in a more android distribution than a gynoid distribution (male pattern of holding fat instead of typical female). It’ll be even more evident in someone in a normal range because there is less fat overall.   Get the hormones and insulin resistance under control and it should resolve.

"Couldn't make it past 36 hours but I felt like that had more to do with dehydration and not being on top of my electrolytes. I always meant to try snake juice (look it up, it's educational) and to try a longer fast but I never felt like more than 36 was necessary for me.   As far as hormone disruption... I wouldn't know what that would be if it did happen. I feel mental clarity and lower anxiety after fasting. It's therapeutic for me. I generally didn't have any ill side effects other than the last hour of my first 36, which is why I ended it there, which was light headedness. I also had a headache around 24 hours but took a magnesium pill and BAM, it was gone. Decided I should just take it slow. And that's how I do it now. Longer just seems unnecessary for me.   I found 16:8 and OMAD severally decreased my hunger mood swings and helped me break my addiction and drive to get high off of glucose spikes. I used to get weak and cranky by 9am without breakfast and now I skip breakfast and go running for an hour/lift weights and eat at 11/12 most days. I don't get tired after I eat healthy. And feeling not hungry is enough, No rush to feel overly full.  I also don't feel the urge to binge on food like I used to, or eat heavy carbs/sugar. I have no sweet tooth now. I don't eat when I am bored or not actually hungry. I can ignore hunger pain easier now for sure. But if I slip back into old habits they come back quickly. A few days of bad habits and being careless and I crave eating too much and dense, calorie rich foods.   My sister is a nurse and was extremely against fasting. She told me I was going to go into starvation mode and balloon out. So I did it and didn't tell her. Never had that issue and I am pretty sure they disproves that's even a thing.

Yeah this used to happen to me when my body was trying to ovulate but couldn’t successfully do it.

"Yes, it’s happened for me both around ovulation and when I was due for my period.   In both cases I’ve wondered if it’s pain from my body attempting to function normally?

"42lbs in 7 months is amazing!!! Congrats!   Metformin is not a weight loss miracle pill, but it definitely does help with the starving hungry days, mood swings, super painful cramping, acne, and other side effects of having pcos.   With metformin, I don't get the ""starving eat everything in the house"" days anymore. It took me two years to lose the first 50 lbs when I first started, and another three years to lose the other 30lbs. That was eating at a very small deficit and resistance training because I couldn't sustain a larger deficit without being miserable and hungry and tired. I allow myself to eat an additional veggie/protein meal if I still feel hungry at the end of the day without gaining additional weight through the week. I'm unsure if that's because of metformin or being on keto, but its a good side effect either way. I do IF and keto and notice I'm not really hungry most days except right before my period.   You might have to up your calories a tiny bit if you're still feeling so hungry all the time after being on metformin for a few weeks. A long time at below maintenance calories can cause extreme mental and physical issues, so please be careful!  Cycling weeks with low &amp; maintenance calories might be a good idea as well to deal with the hunger and still lose weight.",/r/PCOS/comments/f7k72r/tell_me_your_metformin_success_stories_positive/fie6zz5/,comment,2020-02-22 05:51:01-07:00

"The pil and metformine both have a preventive aspect with PCOS.  You need at least 4 periods a year any less and you increase your chances of certain types of cancer. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8005272/ So basically the pill is being given to you as a way to lower your chances of cancer. This includes breastcancer, certain hormonal cancers and all type of reproductive cancers. So if you are not menstruating at all, and you are not trying to get pregnant. Some form of hormonal birth control is recommended.  Now metformine is the same but for diabetes, we have a 50% chance of getting diabetes, off the bat. Without factoring in hereditary diabetes chances and lifestyle. https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/pcos.html  Do you per say need these? Yes and No. I have PCOS but have regular periods since I lost 50kg of weight. Same goes for my insulin resistance. I know that 125kg is my cut off weight and I don't get periods above this weight. There is a big correlation between fat% - insulin resistance and PCOS. So losing weight could be a solution for you. There are different factors, like you can have skinny pcos.  Stopping is up to you. But maybe a good step is changing your diet and exercise routine and keeping the medication and lowering the amount slowly.  Btw it took a gastric bypass for me to lose weight and as soon as the ""effects"" of the bypass got slower I stopped losing weight. But I have lost enough weight to get my periods and get pregnant.",/r/PCOS/comments/f7ons3/the_pill_and_metformin/fidea50/,comment,2020-02-22 03:07:35-07:00
"I do diets, supplements, and exercise only.  Diet was a huge factor for me. If I eat badly or just not conscientiously, I pay for it. I can easily gain weight by not counting calories and macros.   1200-1600 calorie days. (higher cal for more exercise or the night before a long run) I do low carb, so 25% carb calories, 40% fat, 35% protein. Food is fuel, not fun (although I do enjoy it). If I don't eat like it's fuel, I pay for it.   Supplement with fiber, iron, calcium, magnesium, b12, fish oil, and Vit D.   No drinking any calories except maybe a beer or two a week as a treat. I gave up most all desserts unless it's a celebration and it would be weird not to.   Also, I fast. I do 16:8 everyday and OMAD a couple of times a week. I do a 24-36 hour fast once a month, usually. I eat a large salad once a day with protein and healthy fats, lots of fiber veggies and beans.   I have an IUD so I barley get my period and when I do it's light but still not regular.   Once I got my BMI down to low overweight/average, I could lay off a little more and do maintenance which is less work. Right now I'm overweight and need to get back to my old system. I moved and gained almost 20 lbs which is a lot on my small frame.   That's what I did. No drugs.

"I think it was a dermatologist that I needed a referral to see them for insurance purposes and I think they got me in the next day.  My husband, though, needed to see a neurologist and the one in network was about a six month wait (we lived in a smaller city at the time). We ended up just paying out of pocket to see another neurologist, we got in to see him in about 3 weeks and he was cool enough to write us paper bloodwork and MRI writeups instead of sending them electronically to the places he worked with so we could do that in network.  In all it was about $700 for 3 visits, but it was better than waiting around wondering if my husband had brain cancer (which he didn't, turned out he just had massive food allergies).  Another thing, a lot of doctors have cancellation lists, where they call you with a day (or less) notice, make sure you ask about that list. And check if you really need a referral from a doctor through your insurance and maybe shop around for another endocrinologist.",/r/PCOS/comments/f7g032/how_hard_is_it_to_see_an_endocrinologist/ficftls/,comment,2020-02-21 21:31:10-07:00

"-42lb in 7 months is great progress. A healthy rate to lose is 1 or 2lb a week. You are on track with that. Great job! I personally love Metformin. I had very minimal side effects when first starting it, and they were gone after the first week.  I didn't have any luck losing weight on any diet or any kind of exercise until I started taking it. I also saw big time improvement of my hair loss. Metformin is one of the safest and longest prescribed medications available. If all the crazy stuff was true, it would be off the market. You gotta remember that your Dr. prescribed it because they believe it's benefits outweigh the risks in your case, and if we aren't going take our doctors recommendations, what are we paying them for?

In the end, everything was ruled out except pcos.   If you are not having regular cycles, the old blood comes out much darker. Like brown or black.

I don't think I will want to have kids until my mid or late 30s. And I was told that in a way PCOS is a bit an evolutionary advantage. Many with PCOS have a delayed fertility. Instead of being very fertile in our 20s, our most fertile period can be later. This is seen as an advantage because in modern time, women tend to get children at an older age than before. We want an education, career and everything first.

I feel really lucky because IVF doesn’t go as well for a lot of people.  I’ve also always had a great body without putting in much effort. When I first started dating my now husband he asked if I work out all the time (I don’t and probably should do more exercise). But I feel lucky that I look good without having to slave away at the gym. Even now in my 30s,/r/PCOS/comments/f79ou9/whats_a_positive_experience_youve_had_with_pcos/fibh82u/,comment,2020-02-21 14:51:26-07:00

I am going to firmly second the previously stated opinion that things like weight watchers really aren't what you're looking for.   There are quite a few choices for pcos in regards to diet but the main common denominator is a lack of sugar and carbs. To what severity that needs to happen differs for all of us. Some of us have to take the full plunge into keto. Some of us (like myself) can follow a less strict low glycemic diet. No matter what you pick tho it'll need to be a lifestyle change you can keep up in the long term.

I’m doing all the same things. I use carb manager to track my carbs and I never go over 20g. I will sometimes eat a meal of just carbs (around 10g) and the rest of the day eat very low carb.

"A combination of diet and exercise as well as getting on a low dose of levothyroxine for subclinical hypothyroidism (doc said she wouldn’t have put me on it but knew I was trying to conceive and said it was important to get TSH as close to 1 as possible) helped me bring my periods down from six months apart to 54 days apart consistently. I did not do keto but instead eliminated a lot of foods linked to inflammation like gluten, dairy, alcohol, and processed sugar. Once my periods were consistent I was still not conceiving so my doc did three rounds of Letrozole with me at its lowest dose (2.5mg I think?), unmonitored, didn’t need trigger shots or anything, and got pregnant on the third round :)   I have lean PCOS with all the criteria— polycystic ovaries, high androgens (but not testosterone, I have high adrenal androgens), and very infrequent/irregular periods when I was diagnosed.

"I have struggled with my relationship with food for my entire life. I used to be obese, lost 70+ pounds, but then developed hormone issues (have hypo and some sort of PCOS).

Personally, I don't count carbs or eat keto but I aim to eat lower-carb than before and low GI.

"I hear you 100%. I feel like I’ve tried everything for my facial hair. I was shaving it.....there is no way I would leave it long enough to wax.   But last week I wasn’t doing anything in public so I let my facial hair grow for 3 days so that I could get a quote on laser hair removal and also try waxing. After 3 days my hair was super noticeable and I was so uncomfortable...but went and got the laser hair quote- $1008 for 8 30 min sessions or $175/treatment and they recommended I do 8 treatments and see where I am at the end of that. I basically laughed in her face when she told me the pricing as there is no way in hell that I can afford that.   So I go to the salon to get my face waxed for $40....yeah apparently the hair wasn’t long enough, she tried waxing a strip of the hair and the wax wouldn’t grasp it. So I bawled my eyes out for a good couple hours as I don’t want to shave anymore. I have a “shadow” on my face that won’t go away no matter how close of a shave I get. I have tried countless razors, numerous different techniques.....nothing works.   So my boyfriend and I were at Walmart....I was looking at the epilators (which I was not too keen on as I have in the past used them and they are horribly painful.) So I see the Flawless Touch facial hair remover $29.99 (CDN). I was like yeah right this would be too simple. So I decide that $30 isn’t bad and if I wasted $30 whatever.  I took it home tried it. I am wondering why I didn’t do this years ago! I have coarse, dark facial hair....this worked for the most part! It took quite awhile to do, because it’s not really, really powerful and the head of the trimmer is small. You also have to go over the hair in different directions sometimes, but omg to not have to “shave” with a razor with shave oil.....I practically cried, and when I use the flawless touch the shadow is pretty much gone!   I know it’s basically still (shaving)....but it seems to do a great job. It will leave a few hairs, but I just pluck those! But omg I am mad at myself for not trying this sooner. Plus it is so small that if I needed to I could carry it in my purse for touch ups. My skin was so freaking soft after using the flawless touch! I am super impressed with it. You just have to be patient as it takes a bit of time to do a full chin and moustache. You have to move it around your face in circular movements and sometimes it does require you to go over it a few times.

"Fatigue is one of the more common symptoms most women with PCOS have. It can be from insulin resistance, a lack of B12, Vitamin D and/or Iron. If you have issues with insulin resistance and are eating simple carbohydrates it can cause you to feel super tired as well. Along with that, with insulin resistance your cells send signals to tell your brain that they are “starving” which causes the brain to decrease your energy levels and increase your hunger to try get energy in for the starving cells. Hence why the intense simple carb cravings for some which causes the cycle to go round. Unless she’s actually doing blood tests and checking into it your dr can’t say your constant fatigue isn’t due to PCOS for sure. If you’re struggling with tiredness and haven’t had a recent blood test it might need a good idea to get your A1C, iron, B12, Vitamin D and cholesterols (good and bad).  Always good to know where you are at with a blood test, particularly with PCOS. I have one every 6 months to check how I’m tracking (since I had weight loss surgery I’ve had them every 2 months). Not everyone with PCOS has insulin resistance but it’s definitely something to check on and then work with your dr to manage/reduce risk of type 2 diabetes.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6o6y8/im_just_tired/fi9t07k/,comment,2020-02-21 03:27:16-07:00

Beyond that, the common symptoms alone can make life miserable and it's good to be on top of treatment to manage these possible issues: acne, severe weight gain/trouble obtaining a healthy weight, hirsutism (excessive body hair), chronic bloating, chronic inflammation in the body, mood disorders (depression/anxiety - people with PCOS can often be misdiagnosed as being on the bipolar spectrum!).

"Have you looked into taking spironolactone? Technically it is a (rather weak) diuretic, but the ""off label"" use at a much higher dose is as androgen blocker- kind of a side effect that is useful. It will not get rid of the hair growth you already have, but it makes the hair follicle smaller and the hair much finer and lighter in color as well as slower growing. It will also prevent development of additional facial hair follicle activation.  I have been on spiro for over 18 years and have no arm hair, very little leg hair that is very light and fine, and same with arm pit hair. My facial peach fuzz is quite light, only at the sideburn area, and once shaved takes a couple of weeks to come back. My most affected area is my chin, which I do shave daily, but the hair is a lot lighter and finer than before I started spiro, so less noticeable.  There are a couple of cautions with spiro. It has a small potential to damage the liver, so your liver enzymes need to be checked regularly when you first start taking it. (Mine only get done yearly because I've never had any hint of problem with that.) Also, as a systemic androgen blocker, you absolutely should NOT get pregnant while on it as it will affect fetal hormone development. (If you had a male fetus, he could be born with a micropenis, etc.) Therefore, most healthcare providers will not prescribe spiro unless you are reliably taking birth control or are using some other very effective method to prevent pregnancy. Many primary healthcare providers are not familiar with this use of the drug so you may need to see a reproductive endocrinologist for a prescription at the strength needed for androgen blocking.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6wcpx/facial_hair_is_ruining_my_life/fi9fre6/,comment,2020-02-20 22:52:39-07:00

Yes, some people have a peak that only lasts a few hours. (A side note, some people with pcos don't ovulate but will get multiple high peaks as their body tries to ovulate but fails).

"If you're breaking out when you aren't exfoliating everyday, your acne problem likely is not because of dead skin cells and needs to be treated differently. This might be something you need medication for. If it is building up with using makeup, I'd recommend finding makeup with ingredients that do not clog pores, and using an intensive makeup removal regime at the end of the day.  The skin is a living, breathing organ that requires the appropriate balance of conditions both inside and out to be at its best state. While occasional exfoliation helps, overexfoliation irritates it, can expose the skin to further infection, and destroy the sebum barrier. Healing from that takes a lot of time because it does also cause breakouts. I honestly got the worst bout of ingrowns and hyperpigmentation ever when all I did was exfoliate, and thought that anything else would clog my pores. If your skin isn't moist and soft enough, the hairs under the skin cannot break through without being impacted and causing damage.",/r/PCOS/comments/f73997/hyperpigmentation_and_hirsutism/fi8xd8j/,comment,2020-02-20 19:02:30-07:00

"Thank you for answering!  I know exfoliating everyday isn't recommended or ideal :\ I have tried to not do so, but that resulted in both more ingrown hair and eventually acne.  I tend not to be acneic, but - from hat I've noticed from my skin - dead skin cells will eventually build up and start creating those issues. This is especially true with the whole wearing makeup frequently thing. Most vitamin C serums dont do much for me, unfortunately. You're right about hydration though. I've definitely started to try to balance both hydration and exfoliation. For every product I have that exfoliates, I have one that's meant to hydrate and, in the morning, I only use hydrating products.

I was on the high end of normal when my doc put me on it a few years ago, I came off of it because it didn’t do much for me back then but now I’m trying to get pregnant and my insulin is a little worse so I’m back on it. Spironolactone can help with acne and hair growth (I think accutane is just for acne?) because it can regulate high testosterone levels.   Birth Control is the most common RX for PCOS. It will help cysts not to form, but it’s just a bandaid that stops your cycles instead of regulating them. It won’t make things worse for you, but you shouldn’t just take BC and do nothing else.

"You should not be exfoliating everyday. You're eroding your skin more than you're cleaning away dead skin cells, at that rate. You should moisturize more instead and cut out constant exfoliation to encourage skin healing - the more moisture the skin retains, the better it is at healing scars.  I have tons of hyperpigmentation as well. Overexfoliation made it worse and I'm focusing on hydration. You can also use Vit C or hyaluronic acid serums. Also, don't try to tear through your skin to dig out hairs - get a professional to bring it out. They usually can do so without scarring.

"I want to emphasize the first point made here. Since you asked to get a little scared into seeking care, my tumor was discovered through the testing process to get a PCOS diagnosis. To get a PCOS diagnosis you have to rule out the other conditions that it can mimic. Left untreated, both PCOS and the other conditions it mimics can do some damage to your body. I definitely recommend seeing a doctor!    Here is what happened to me:   I saw my primary care doctor a few months ago after I started losing a lot of hair, like 3-4x what was normal for me. I also started getting acne again despise using retin-a, which had cleared up my acne last summer after struggling with it for 3 years. I also I had stopped taking oral contraceptives a couple months prior and started a medication about 6 months prior that sometimes can cause hair loss, so we thought that’s what was causing it. She also tested my thyroid, iron and ferritin, testosterone, and   DHEA-S levels. The DHEA-S (an androgen) was high but everything else was normal, but some of these were borderline normal but she was t concerned. She had me restart the pill and get off the other medication and referred me to a women’s health doctor. Stopping the other medication stopped the hair loss but on the OCs my period became irregular around this time and I had like a 3 week long period (I was on a 90-day cycle OC). It was heavier than usual but not painful. Anytime I’ve been on or off OCs I had a normal light to medium period with minimal pain so this was weird for me. My acne also got really bad, it was all throughout the t-zone, cystic, and painful when it typically was not cystic or painful and limited to my forehead.  The women’s health doctor suspected PCOS but was suspicious because acne seemed to be the only symptom, assuming medication changes accounted for the other symptoms. Before the visit I did a lot of research into PCOS and the conditions that it mimics because I had read it’s the most common cause of DHEA-S elevation at the levels mine were at (high but not high enough to suggest cancer). One way my anxiety manifests is being a bit of a hypochondriac and researching health stuff for hours. Having a background in biology/health sciences kind of enables this. I found that PCOS can mimic late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia (or non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, NCAH). I happen to be Yupik and CAH is much more common in this group (1 in 400 vs  1 in 100,000) so I wondered if I carried the gene. I told her about my concerns of NCAH, my ethnic background, my hypochondriac tendencies, and shared the link (UpToDate if you’re curious, it’s what the doctors at my school use and I have access as a student). She ordered a 17-OHP test which came back normal. She thought the OCs could interfere with this so she had me stop OCs for two months before retesting. She ordered 17-OHP, prolactin, testosterone, and DHEA-S. All were normal except for DHEA-S, which was still high. My period was still irregular too. She wasn’t confident about a PCOS diagnosis so she referred me to an endocrinologist.   I met with the endocrinologist and she said after reviewing the tests and my history she was certain I had PCOS but to diagnose it she had to rule out other conditions. CAH/NCAH had already been ruled out. She ordered cortisol, cortisol suppression, LH, and FSH tests - all normal, ruling out Cushing’s syndrome and hyperprolactinemia. She also ordered a CT scan to rule out tumors, which I went to get on Tuesday. They put an IV line in before the scan in case the radiologist thinks it’s necessary to inject contrast and do more scans. When they were putting it in I thought it seemed medically unnecessary and kinda wasteful to have me get a CT scan when it was almost certainly PCOS. After the initial scan the tech came in and basically asked me how the doctor knew about the tumor and I was like “uhhhhhh we didn’t know about that, were ruling it out for PCOS because my DHEA-S is high.” I think they accidentally told me because they assumed that we had found it by ultrasound. The radiologist wanted more more scans with contrast so they scanned me a minute after contrast injection (weirdest sensation) then again 15 minutes later. I laid in the machine waiting between scans like wtf I have a tumor while trying to sooth myself by meditating that I read that most of these kinds of tumors are benign. It super sucked. The techs said a radiologist would send the results to the endocrinologist within a couple of hours. I tried to read the scans and did research in the meantime. The scans didn’t help at all because obviously I have no clue what it shows but what I read made it seem very likely that the tumor would be benign. The endocrinologist didn’t call until early the next morning (yesterday) and she said I have a small tumor. She suspects the tumor is functional (androgen secreting) and benign, so that’s good news. I get more imaging soon and will have surgery to get it out. I’ve read that most surgeries for this are laparoscopic and non-invasive, which is also good news. I asked what treatment would be if I didn’t want surgery and she said it would be similar to PCOS treatment with androgen blockers. I’m glad to know what’s been causing these problems and that removing the tumor will fix it. And I’m a little relieved that I won’t need another medication, especially since I’ve heard spiro has some undesirable side effects.    Wow, sorry for sharing my whole life story! Hopefully some of these details can help anyone going through the process of diagnosis.   tldr: You should definitely see a doctor because there’s a chance it’s not PCOS - it wasn’t for me! And leaving PCOS or other conditions that it mimics untreated can harm your health. Doctors thought I had PCOS because acne, periods, hair loss, and elevated DHEA-S but it’s basically an acne tumor. Other conditions were ruled out by blood and saliva tests while a CT scan ruled out PCOS because it showed I have a benign tumor on my adrenal gland that’s functional (secretes androgens). I’m very relieved that we caught it, know what has been causing these issues, and that the issues will go away after surgery. Hopefully you can find relief in seeking care and getting a diagnosis.

"Wow this sounds incredibly familiar except I haven’t had my IUD removed yet. I suspect my doc is gonna request it based on my last blood results, I don’t think my IUD is doing enough for me hormonally. But I’m also bipolar and struggle with moods frequently despite being on medication. With my recent blood work coming back I can’t help but wonder how much of my mood problems are hormonal rather than my mental illness. It’s a really tough balance and one hell of a double whammy.   I think that even people who aren’t bipolar go through hormone/mood changes with the insertion and removal of IUDs but there’s just an added factor for people like us. I’d definitely recommend finding a new specialist and maybe a psychiatrist that you trust and who listens to you. This is a case where you have to be super careful about EVERYTHING, food, sleep, social habits, etc. it’s a lot but stability is worth it, I think.

"I got the mirena IUD even without having had a child, it was uncomfortable but not debilitatingly painful. I always recommend an IUD when people ask me about it because the insertion is brief and even if it’s painful it provides a lot of benefits. As for the PCOS side of it, I’m not sure anymore because I’ve had my IUD for 3 years and just had blood work done on my annual and my testosterone was double what it should be. I don’t think it’s doing the job hormonally and may end up back on BCP but everyone is different so I think it’s worth a shot.

I have thick dark coarse hair and it was growing in very thickly on my chin and neck.  A few years back I decided to do something about it.  Laser was too expensive so I went with electrolysis and it has changed my life.  When I started out my growth was so thick that I would have to go back weekly to have it redone.  Gradually as time went on and I had to go less and less. I went from once per week to once every two and then once per month.  Now I go once every 4 - 5 months for a 20 minute touch up and can barely see any hair at the end of those 4 months.   There are several options available. Do what works best for you and your budget.

"My epilator changed my life. Is it painful? Yes somewhat. Does it make me go hair free for at least a week and make my self consciousness go away? Also yes. Or you could get your face and neck threaded once every week or two weeks. Costs about 15 bucks and all you have to do is grin and bear it.   But honestly. The 40 bucks I spent on my braun silk epil changed my life. I first bought one in tenth grade and it still worked up until last year (10 years) when I moved continents and forgot it.   Bought the same one and I spend an hour or two on Friday’s getting my body hair free.  Each Friday I do my face and armpits (after a very thorough shower of course) and then I’ll alternate upper body and lower body. One Friday I’ll do legs and the next I’ll do arms, chest, and abdomen. And once a month or so I’ll get a Brazilian because there’s no way I’m doing that on my own.  This takes about an hour every week and has made me feel like an actual human woman and not Chewbacca.

I was told this too.  I was given prescriptions for fertility drugs and was told I would only achieve a menstrual cycle by taking the pill.    I called bullshit.   I began a quest to recover from PCOS.   Twelve years and two kids later I can say my doctor was 100% WRONG.  I have a regular cycle and both kids were born without fertility drugs.  I am now a holistic nutritionist that specializes in PCOS.   I know that everyone has their own unique issues and not all outcomes will be the same BUT I  think that the message people are trying to give you is that doctors are people and therefore imperfect. Many doctors have been wrong about many things.  None of us should ever be too certain about anything.   Life is full of surprises.

"shaving doesn't change the texture/color/rate of hair growth. the reason people think it does is because instead of a tapered end there is only a blunt stub of hair that may make it look a tad darker. I shaved every day- twice sometimes 3x a day and it definitely did not make my hairgrowth worse, just kinda tedious. in the end shaving gave me way more confidence than not shaving or relying only on plucking (which would take me an hour)- so as long as it doesn't completely irritate your skin I say go for it.  I ended up getting laser hair removal and it was amazing. the in between appointments I hardly ever had to shave.

"There are other conditions that mimic PCOS, so I wouldn’t be too quick to jump to conclusions. As someone who’s had multiple and unrelated health issues and hospital visits over the years, I’ve always felt it’s worse not knowing what you have and worrying about it than dealing with an actual diagnosis.   If you do have PCOS, you’re at higher risk of endometrial cancer if you go too long without a period (doctors generally recommend inducing one with medication at least every three months to reduce this risk). Many people with PCOS have high insulin levels or insulin resistance, putting them at risk of type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications, such as heart disease, strokes, etc.   PCOS is not life-threatening if managed properly. Treatment will depend on your goals. Diet and exercise are usually the first line of treatment. Some opt for metformin to help with insulin resistance and bring back their periods. Others go for birth control to suppress androgen levels. If fertility is a concern, there are medications for that as well.   It’s tough to face your fears, but you’ll grow stronger for it. Find a doctor you trust and work with them. That’s one way of taking care of yourself.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6viks/i_probably_have_pcos/fi7a2gv/,comment,2020-02-20 09:48:54-07:00

Make sure to wear cotton lined rubber gloves if you have to wash dishes/handle other household chemicals by hand.  This might sound weird but the thing that got the skin on my hands looking almost nice again was when I was working as a baker and wearing vinyl gloves all day (latex gloves are usually powdered and I think that irritated my skin more).

Ovarian cysts or lack thereof are not sufficient by itself to diagnose PCOS. Some women with PCOS don’t present with cysts at all. Your other two symptoms - excess androgen a la beard and irregular ovulation - are more indicative of PCOS.

"Not everyone who has PCOS has shaving issues. I can only speak for myself. I had extremely course black hair on my legs (full legs, including inner thigh). Not only was it course but it was plentiful. If I shaved when the hair was long it was OK (but it returned the next day). It grew faster than weeds. Even when I waxed it grew back quickly. The stubble came in, some still under a thin layer of skin. When I shaved I would nic myself, on top of that, my sensitive skin couldn't handle more shaving (only once per week). Even then, it didn't look good, you could see the dark hair beneath the skin.   The inner thigh was the worst. If I shaved or waxed there I would get painful welts that lasted for weeks.

"Firstly, you are amazing! I really love the level of commitment you have put into journaling and tracking the patterns of PCOS on the individual body. I really applaud you for doing that. I use the LoseIt app everyday to keep a handle on overall calories but have never journaled. I’m sure it would be very beneficial to do this as an aid in mindful eating—there is so much truth when you say “it’s the diet but not quite”.   Congratulations on having the insight to get to know yourself and your particular symptoms so well. And I think there is some merit when you say I may be trying to outrun my hormones. I am very driven and perhaps treat my body, occasionally, more harshly than I should trying to keep things in line. Part of the issue with PCOS is that we are all in places like Reddit talking to each other about our symptoms because the endocrinologists and gynecologists DON’T understand the intricacies of this syndrome. Eat less and move more only gets you to a certain point. Funny thing is, when I was training for a thru hike in Europe this past September, after I was done with that I continued to lose weight without trying—almost as if my body responded better to distance hiking than running.

"Yes I do, and also maybe back then the symptoms just weren’t as present. My endo’s also mentioned (and I’ve researched this myself) most people with PCOS’s symptoms start to flare up in their 20’s the worst. So perhaps she might have been working against you then?   But again you only need two of 3 criteria. 1 is erratic/irregular periods 2 is excess male hormones (sometimes visible in cases of hirsutism, but blood tests usually help.) and 3 is the ovaries looking like those two pictures I showed you.   If you’re not sexually active it might be a bit uncomfortable for you. I’m sexually active and at times it was kinda? Painful for me, but I have low tolerance. The machine thing is a little bigger than a tampon but still at times it felt kinda bad when they really tried to move around to see better.   It also helps if you have any family history of PCOS.  The only real reason why they looked at PCOS for me was because I did NOT shave a week prior to the appointment to really show how bad my hair is (even if it was embarrassing) and I mentioned that my sister also has PCOS even tho no other woman in the family has it.

"Also wanted to add- I didn’t have a single “cyst” ... my two endocrinologists (yes I had two supervising the appt) told me that PCOS shouldn’t even be the term for PCOS because you don’t need cysts to have PCOS and a lot of women with PCOS actually have lots of tiny follicles that aren’t maturing properly rather than cysts (though some do)     [Here](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/9629456-3x2-700x467.jpg) is slightly what my ovaries looked like. They both agreed that some doctors diagnose it at 12 or more of these in the ovaries but some doctors diagnose at 25.  I had a total of 60 combined. One had 19 and the other had 41. I met all 3 of 3 criteria for PCOS, and you only need to meet 2 of 3 to be diagnosed.   At the first appointment I already had two HOWEVER they still wanted the blood work to be 110% sure since they said even though it was rare, it could be Cushing’s or a thyroid issue etc. I did not get any formal diagnosis until the blood work came back positive.  [here’s another pic](https://www.intechopen.com/media/chapter/45102/media/image37_w.jpg) that might be helpful.  I was also told that androgens usually peak around mid day so try to get an appointment around 10am-2PM for the most chances at a positive blood result. I’m not sure how accurate this is (saw this on this sub, but my own appointment was scheduled at 1:45 and I had an insanely high amount ... so)",/r/PCOS/comments/f6p8zi/not_sure_if_i_have_pcosshould_pursue_a_diagnosis/fi6vmsh/,comment,2020-02-20 07:22:15-07:00

"Yes but make sure you’re seeing a reproductive endocrinologist and ask for a vaginal ultrasound. You can’t really self diagnose PCOS because PCOS can look like many different things (which is why doctors seem so dumb sometimes. They usually try to rule everything else out first. It sucks for us because we have to wait a while for the diagnosis sometimes, but most doctors are just trying to be careful)",/r/PCOS/comments/f6p8zi/not_sure_if_i_have_pcosshould_pursue_a_diagnosis/fi6ufku/,comment,2020-02-20 07:08:00-07:00
"I’m sorry this has been so hard for you. I struggle too with being somewhat of an outlier in terms of PCOS. Although I do get periods and ovulate, my LH and AMH have never been elevated, I never had androgen excess, and generally I don’t seem to have a lot of the obvious markers that can easily be improved to help with symptoms, so it was incredibly hard to figure out what I needed to do to help my symptoms.   Have you tried any supplements? Metformin never worked for me, presumably because my insulin/A1C was not terrible, but supplements helped. Because my hormones and various labs weren’t really out of range it was a lot of trial and error, and I was kind of flying blind because we couldn’t use labs to gauge whether they were working (I had to rely on intuitive symptom checking), but eventually I found a supplement regiment that helped.   The biggest misconception about PCOS that I hate is “lose weight and it will get better” it is just emphatically untrue. When overweight women with PCOS lose weight and see improvement in their symptoms they assume that it is the weight loss, but in reality there is some other change or changes that contributed. As you said it is obviously better for our health generally to be at a healthy weight, but there is less of a connection to PCOS and weight than a lot of people realize. When I stopped focusing on my weight and instead focused on using specific foods to help my symptoms, I got better.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6lhbh/specialist_says_you_cant_have_kids_hes_a_quack/fi6ueom/,comment,2020-02-20 07:07:43-07:00

"In somewhat defence of your boss I'm pretty sure what she said was meant to comfort rather than offend, also I've had my fertility Dr essentially call my GP a quack after he told me I would not be able to conceive naturally if at all and was infertile. I also think it's important Drs don't use 'infertile' as a blanket diagnosis as I think stress of course plays a major part when TCC and after being told this we failed to conceive  month after month. I then went to the fertility Dr who explained whilst my symptoms are quite severe (or certainly were they seem to have gotten ever so slightly better) as I'm having monthly but irregular periods I am in fact ovulating and therefore able to conceive and stated that the GP didn't know what they were talking about and therefore shouldn't pass comment. The very same month of finding out we could conceive we did (though this ended in a miss at the 6/7 week mark) and I honestly think this was aided by the absence of stress and upset at the thought of never being able to have children naturally. I think that is why so many woman try to point out positive stories regarding conceiving/pregnancy etc as despite the likes of PCOS being so common, it affecting only women I think has led it to be majorly under researched and miss understood so women themselves are sharing their knowledge or experience in a hope to better inform and understand.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6lhbh/specialist_says_you_cant_have_kids_hes_a_quack/fi6csax/,comment,2020-02-20 01:48:15-07:00
I’m so glad for you! I recently started taking Metformin again I had stopped because it started to make me feel sick and then my period went away for three months.

I agree. Unless there’s more going on that *just* PCOS then any “specialist” shouldn’t be telling you that you cannot get pregnant with a few rather minor changes like taking metformin and losing 10% of your body weight. That’s not invasive medical intervention.  If that specialist also sells his IVF services I’d absolutely use the word quack.

I use nexplanon and haven’t had many issues. The only real problem isn’t really a problem but more of an inconvenience. The nonstop bleeding is a nightmare I had to live with for a few months. Got to the point where even my bf was like omg why are you always bleeding?! Lol it’s a bit of a shock considering I almost never had a period and it had gotten to the point where it wouldn’t stop. Other than that I don’t have complaints. I’ve had it for almost a year and a half and it’s so nice not to have to worry about anything cuz it’s just there doing it’s thing. I would definitely get it again. :) Good luck!

"Nah.  Polycystic-appearing ultrasounds are not specific for PCOS.  Women without PCOS regularly have them and women with PCOS regularly don't.  It's pretty much the least useful diagnostic trait, which is why it is super unfortunate that the syndrome is called PCOS.  High androgens or clinical signs of hyperandrogenism such as male-pattern hirsutism or acne are generally a much clearer component of a diagnosis of PCOS.  The other symptom used in the diagnosis is irregular menstrual cycles, which are usually not possible to determine without getting off birth control, because birth control suppresses ovulation preventing the traditional menstrual cycle.  If I had my druthers I'd recommend the diagnosis be shifted to just high androgens or clinical signs of it and irregular cycles, because the ultrasounds can bring in a lot of false positives (and negatives) that confuse or frighten women.  Focusing on the androgens leads to a more specific and treatable diagnosis.  (This is actually the [recommendation of the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society Board of Directors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028208013927).)    What I'd really like to see over ultrasound screening is more literacy among doctors about PCOS, its causes and effects, and more understanding of what treatments work and don't.  Right now when you go to a gynecologist or PCP it's a total crapshoot of whether they'll know about it, and if they do, whether that knowledge is recent or helpful.

"Unfortunately, your specialist isn't a quack but they are either plain wrong (usually out of date or uninformed) or accidentally misleading you about the difficulty of getting pregnant.  I'm sorry they put you through this.  I'm also sorry that your coworker and boyfriend are not listening when you are expressing your fears about your future, because information like that is scary and potentially life-changing, and even if they don't think your doctor's assessment is accurate they should have gone about telling you with a lot more kindness and understanding of what you are going through.  A more reasonable thing for doctors to say to PCOS women is something like ""Many women with PCOS have a more complicated route to pregnancy than average.  When you are ready to have children, there are doctors who can help you if you need it, although some PCOS women are able to conceive without assistance of any sort.  In the mean time focusing on your overall metabolic health in general is your best approach.""  If patients need, they can provide details about dietary and lifestyle changes that are conducive towards metabolic and reproductive health in PCOS women, and details about what medical steps there are if those changes aren't enough.  Women with PCOS frequently do not need IVF because the root cause of lack of pregnancy in PCOS is anovulation.  If you fix the ovulation, in most cases if you only have PCOS (and not an additional infertility condition), you can get pregnant with the same odds as any other woman.  Many (but not all) women with PCOS are able to achieve ovulation with dietary and lifestyle changes, and many get pregnant accidentally when they implement these changes for other reasons.  If dietary and lifestyle don't work, the ""pills"" to induce ovulation for PCOS are about $12/mo and are really no big deal to take.  (I'm on those pills right now.)  Your specialist (whatever their specialty) is in common company though. Most gynecologists and PCP know almost nothing about treating PCOS.  If you do decide in the future that you want to have children, you will need to see a reproductive endocrinologist.  Keep in mind that most RE are driven by success rates and make a lot off money off IVF as that is their primary business, so they may push you toward it just for the expedience of the process compared to timed cycles with letrozole/Clomid and the profit margins, but most PCOS women with only PCOS don't need it, so the good ones will lead you towards ovulation induction first depending on your age.  As a tail note, I believed I was infertile most of my life but in the last few years found out that was really only partially true by reading recent research on PCOS.  When I got married a few years ago my husband and I started down the process of trying to become parents, which we knew would likely be complicated for reasons likely on both sides.  We are still prepared to adopt, but think odds are still quite good that won't be needed.  The last year I've been doing letrozole cycles with my RE while also doing keto to maintain my insulin levels as I'm 35 and don't have time due to my age to do things slowly, and I've ovulated each of the last 7 times exactly on time.  If our condition was only PCOS, my doctor says I would likely be pregnant by now.  The road to pregnancy with PCOS is not always straight, but at least in my case, it's not PCOS preventing it for now.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6lhbh/specialist_says_you_cant_have_kids_hes_a_quack/fi62nt0/,comment,2020-02-19 22:37:01-07:00

"Me! I'm so glad to have found this topic. Congrats, you are so much more ahead of me in terms of progress.  I have been trying to find out a proper research on muscle gain and training with PCOS, but sometimes I find contradicting ideas. For example, I read that HIIT might be good, but others papers say that light cardio is the way to go. I think it all depends on the body and the symptoms. So, what works for me might not be necessarily good for you. The symptoms are wide and our bodies have different needs.   I have been training in the gym for the past year or so, doing weights and running. Recently I have become interested in *training for a 10k run* (final goal is to do a full marathon in 2021). I have tried different approaches (still researching, giving myself at least a year to analyze &amp; compile data) and I can tell you what I have so far:  August 2019:   * **Gym schedule:** trained for 5 days a week: 2 days weight training, 2 HIIT, and in the evening run for 2-3 times / week. I took no full break days (silly)  * **Food:** Doing IF. Ate salads, rice with meat or fish, and a lot fruits (watermelon mostly). I was only doing portion control mostly, so basically, try to eat just half the portion most times, and be satisfied, but not too hungry. Did something that I called ""cheat day, but don't go overboard"" on Saturday or Sunday. Trying to do 1400 - 1500 cal / day.  * **Weight:** ""lost"" 400 grams (0.8 pounds) , muscle mass remained the same * **Overall happiness:** 7 / 10 - I was constantly sleepy, could barely work sometimes. Developed a 'mild' food anxiety, and I had a lot of carvings that sometimes translated into eating sugar, and back to the gym as 'punishment'.   I took a 1 week break around here from all gym activities.   September - October 2019:  * **Gym schedule:** 2 days weight training, 2 HIIT, run in the evening, but with 2 full break days for the week. I think I was becoming tired on this point. * **Food:** Doing IF. Aimed for 1400 average weekly calories (instead of daily kalorie goal) and trying to pack a lot of protein in. So, it was mostly chicken, boiled eggs and boiled vegetables or brown rice. I cannot eat boiled chicken now. I was missing the mark on a lot of days, having days with more calories, and days where I would be hungry. * **Weight:** gained some kg in September, but in October I was at the same level as in August (I was really pushing myself with a low cal diet). I did not gain any muscle mass. * **Overall happiness:** 6 / 10. I missed cake, because it's my bday in October, and I said I would take it back, but never did. I was more upset I wasn't loosing weight.  I took a 1 week break around here from all gym activities.   November - December 2019:  * **Gym schedule:** 4 days weight training (2 upper body, 1 lower body, 1 full body at 50% max weight capacity) and 2 running days at most * **Food:** Stopped doing IF. Eating some fruits in the morning. I did a ""70% vegan diet"", and I ate a lot of tofu, vegetables, brown rice, stir fried broccoli, nuts &amp; seeds. I was eating plant based food for breakfast and lunch, no animal products. For dinner I had some protein with salad or rice or vegetables.  * **Weight:** Gained. LOL! And I did not gain any muscle mass. I think I was up 3 - 3.5 kg (6 - 7 pounds).  * **Overall happiness:** 6 / 10. It was so hard to eat plant based. I was missing out a lot, and it did not help my cravings. I just wanted to eat more, and I was a little pissed off that my weight went up.  I took a 1 break (it was xmas and NY so..) from all dieting and gym activities.   January 2020:  * **Gym schedule:** 4 days weight training. Decided to start slow * **Food:** somehow, my weight went down in the Xmas break. Stopped IF, ate greek yogurt &amp; oats in the morning. Or oats with milk and a small side of fruits. Started a challenge to eat 1 salad every day (for lunch) for 3 weeks. I completed the challenge, and it was fun. I integrated some lean protein or seafood in the salad. Sometimes I had salad for dinner too. But always a side of protein (tofu, fish, mostly chicken). * **Weight:** same-same. So I managed to maintain what I lost during the break.  * **Overall happiness:** 7 / 10. I was happy that I had and end date to my salad challenge. It was fun, I had less cravings I guess, but I was a bit hungry every once in a while.   **Concussions so far:**  **Food:** I have started to have a 'high protein' breakfast. I usually have a protein shake with oats or yogurt or a cup of fruits. I have discovered that I don't feel hungry shortly after. I could go without eating lunch until 2PM. After the salad challenge in January, I started eating more salads almost daily, but I am careful to pack protein into it, or to simply replace the rice and get the salad as a side dish. I have fun with it and test out different salad dressings to ""oomph"" the taste. If I have carvings through the day, I usually eat some fruits (watermelon is still my favorite). At the end of the day, I try to have a good carbs, fat, protein balance (30% F, 40% C, 30% P - something around these lines). What I do differently, is that  I thrive for 80% consistency rather than 100%. I say that 80% is consistency, and 20% I live my life. I still eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, even when I'm not trying to be consistent.   **Gym:** I have lost weight during my off time! So I stick to 4 days of weights, and 2 days of running. I make sure I get proper rest between gym times. I am still testing it out, but I feel good, and I have the lowest weight I ever had. I will incorporate more running time in the future.   **Overall happiness:** 8.5 / 10. I am trying to break a food anxiety issue I have harnessed during my IF days. I have stopped eating a lot of foods: french fries, bread, croissants, ramen, classic burgers.  But I have also discovered so many new foods I enjoy eating: seafood, curry with tofu, spicy stir fried foods, fish with garlic, all the fruits ever. I also enjoy in moderation some fried chicken, tonkatsu, impossible burger, dim sum and tacos!  I thought that I had to do a whole lot of things to keep my PCOS under control. That's why I started doing this ""study"" on myself. Now, I feel like it's more of a balance between enjoying life, and doing sports for the love of sports. It seems to me like you are trying to outrun your hormones. With PCOS it's the diet, but not quite. Being in a calorie deficit and doing physical activity helps up until one point. It's also important to treat your body right.   Wishing you the best with your marathon. I hope I will get to your level soon enough. Please let me know how this goes for you.

"&gt;She said cut roasting to avoid the olive oil I toss the veggies in, and that fish is high in fat.  Yeah, I understood that.  But it's extremely dumb advice when combined with advice to severely restrict carbs, which is what she's suggesting by saying you should remove crackers.  Your calories have to come from something, and if she's reducing carbs, the best recommendation is to increase the amount of fat to compensate. (Obviously it doesn't take a lot since fat is more calorie dense than carbohydrates per gram, but fat increases satiety so it literally doesn't take a lot.)  The only other option is to significantly increase protein to compensate for both lost fat and lost carbs, and that looks more like a carnivore diet, which is also pretty high in fat since people can literally only eat so much protein.  Basically, roasting your veggies in oil or fat is totally fine and she's ridiculous to tell you to cut that to lose weight.  Nobody gets fat off fish, roasted veggies, and a few crackers.  Something else is going on, whether with your diet, your meds, or your hormones.  That's why I recommend checking your diet with cronometer/MyFitnessPlanner and seeing an endocrinologist who is good with those things.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6l5ja/trying_to_mentally_prep_for_my_follow_up_with_the/fi60d6b/,comment,2020-02-19 22:04:36-07:00

"I have PCOS, but my skin also hates me, so I've had all sorts of eczema and dermatitis, elbows, hands, lips, eyes, scalp, wherever. I can't wash dishes anymore because my hands get itchy and flaky.

"Qualities I look for in a good doctor:  1. Competence - this is a mixture of experience and education. Do they have any research or clinical experience specializing in PCOS? If not, are they passionate about women’s health and approach healthcare from a proactive, preventative angle with the understanding that women are underrepresented in medical research and sometimes have very different symptoms and healthcare needs than men?  How many years have they practised medicine independently? Personally, I think the sweet spot is somewhere between 10-15 years - enough that they’re not completely green, but not so experienced they think they know everything, but that’s just my experience. There are definitely exceptions!  2. Bedside manner/soft skills - they are good at compassionate empathy. They listen to your concerns without any moral judgment or assumptions and form a treatment plan together with you, rather than minimize or dismiss your concerns. You feel like no problem is too small or insignificant to bring up to your doctor. You can ask them questions and they will take the time to explain their answers to you or tell you honestly when they don’t know something.   3. Administrative/support staff - sometimes good doctors surround themselves with incompetent admin, and no matter how good the doctor is, it’s a pain to book appointments, get timely referrals, process insurance claims, etc. Good admin make a huge difference to the overall experience.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6lnlz/what_to_look_for_in_a_doctor/fi5o3jn/,comment,2020-02-19 19:52:04-07:00

"So she both told you to cut back on carbs (crackers) and fat (cheese)?  And told you to cut out roasted veggies?  She sounds like a terrible terrible excuse for a nutritionist (obviously -- she isn't a nutritionist).  Your original diet sounded pretty great, although personally I don't do crackers because I'm keto, but if you're not keto a few crackers isn't going to kill you.  If you're considering cutting carbs to improve your insulin resistance, which is totally fine, you don't need to also cut your fats, and doing so would be in fact be counterproductive.  In addition you should eat your veggies whatever way you like them, and you don't need to avoid using a little butter/oil to cook them.  Also, fish is good!  WTF this lady.  I do wonder about your insulin resistance and quick weight changes.  I would suspect that your med changes are more influencing your weight gain over your diet.  If you're concerned though, use Cronometer of MyFitnessPlanner or so for a week and really honestly track your meals and see what your calorie count actually looks like.  900 calories a day is stupidly low and *will* crash your metabolism, but if you're doing CICO you should look to keep it under 2000 for maintenance and then cut a little bit off of that to lose weight at the rate of a pound or two a week.  There are lots of calculators online for this.  If you've already done this then your problem probably isn't food but your meds or a medical problem.  My suggestion: get a referral to an endocrinologist.  At least that would get you away from this terrible gynecologist.  Also as a pre-diabetic, consider reading The Diabetes Code by Dr.  Fung as it really covers what helps this condition.",/r/PCOS/comments/f6l5ja/trying_to_mentally_prep_for_my_follow_up_with_the/fi5imhf/,comment,2020-02-19 18:59:06-07:00

"My dad is a t2 diabetic and he swears by buckwheat. For me (IR), buckwheat skyrockets my blood sugar like most other grains  I’ve found hulled barley (not pearled) works really well for a source of fiber w/o the glucose spike. I get a hefty bag for like 13-15 bucks online and it lasts a long while (like months). About a handful cooked makes me feel pretty full.  The secret for this - and this is a crucial step - after cooking it, refrigerating it. The refrigeration changes the shape of the carbohydrates, and they’re not absorbed as fast as a result.  I like to eat it cold - like mixing it into a salad. Almost no impact on glucose. But even reheating it after the cooling process isn’t so bad on it either.

I have really red cheeks and kind of yellow ish skin so makeup matching was hard for me anyway and add to the fact I have a mustache I have to shave and chin hairs and really dry skin. It's not a liquid foundation but a stick so it covers really well, I add a bit of bronzer and I'm ready to go. Unlike grocery store makeup I can't see the makeup sitting on my face fuzz. They make a moisturizer and it made a big difference. If I forget to add it you can see my dry spots mostly on my T line and nose so just 2 pumps of that rub it on wait a few minutes and makeup over it. You use it at night and in the morning, seems to work better then lotion for me at least. If you have one near you at a mall, stop in and get a free makeup job and see if you like it. I also have sensitive skin and it hasn't clogged my pores or anything and it doesn't feel heavy. It's a bit expensive. I got about $120 in makeup (just the lipstick is $20) but they tossed in another $120 in free makeup, like full sized samples so it was a win for me, cause I didn't need to get mascara or lip stick or blush, they just tossed it all in. And it was like opening a blind bag, I just kept finding more stuff packed away in the makeup box.

"I was on spironolactone for 2 years, but had to stop taking it due to the side effects I experience. However, it is important to know this is just based on my personal experience and most people have very positive experiences with spironolactone and I would still recommend trying it! :)   I took 50 mg/day for 2 years and the positive, observable side effects I noticed were a 75% reduction in acne + softer skin, 50% reduction in body hair, and 100% increase in hair growth on my head. I got so many compliments on my hair while I was on spironolactone it was insane. I also noticed my face became more *feminine*? I know that sounds strange and I am not sure if it was a placebo effect though lol.   I stopped taking it because at the time, I was struggling with an ED and replacing meals with coffee, which was a **terrible** idea since spironolactone is a diuretic. I did not take care of myself at all. I might go back on spironolactone now that I am at a normal weight and eating regularly and cutting down on caffeine. I am also planning on completing a series of laser/electrolysis treatments to decrease the thickness of the hair; so currently saving up for that.",/r/PCOS/comments/f5wx5x/will_balancing_my_hormones_restore_my_female/fi2ug1j/,comment,2020-02-18 22:17:36-07:00
"For me personally the most alleviation I everrrr felt for my mental health issues was the very  first time I tried clean eating (basically paleo). Everytime I fell off and went back it definitely helped but wasnt as big of a difference probably because my body was used to bein overloaded with sugar/carbs before that so it was just a stark contrast. I'm in a tough spot right now so clean eating is hard but whenever I get the chance again I think the best bet for mental health is to look at it from all my angles: so eat well for insulin resistance(low sugar low carb), workout (even light things like yoga just some form of movement often), supplements(figure out what your body needs but some good supps for pcos-ers usually include: inositol, vit D, magnesium) and rest!! find some form of stress relief daily whether thats meditation, a warm bath, a good book, painting etc. good luck!!! we got this",/r/PCOS/comments/f63ui6/depressionanxiety/fi2tiye/,comment,2020-02-18 22:04:27-07:00
"OP, I am not exactly sure what you're asking, but based on what I think you are asking...    I have been told that Depression/anxiety can be linked with PCOS and it can act as a catalyst, but in my experience, managing my symptoms of PCOS did not cease the need for intervention with my mental health needs.   However, lifting weights 3 days a week and doing things like hiking and reading outdoors in the weekends does HELP make my depression and anxiety more manageable, but i feel that this is absolutely going to be a case specific scenario and depends on what you and your health care professional feel is best for you and your symptoms.   Unfortunately PCOS is not a one size fits all situation and neither is depression or anxiety.   If you're asking whether PCOS is linked to depression and anxiety, the answer is yes. PCOS can catalyze A LOT of things. For example, everyone has testosterone, female sufferers of PCOS have an exponential amount compared to non-suffering females. Its the same with androgens, too much,  and we have an insufficient amount of progestins which all females have, PCOS sufferers just tend to not have enough.

"I don't mean to freak you out but of all the things threatening your life at any given moment, PCOS isn't in the top 50. You should try to find support from family and friends. Better yet, if you have access to a counsellor or therapist (if your parents have insurance, you'll be covered) you should see them about the anxiety you're experiencing.  PCOS is totally manageable, even more so for you since you're young and can prevent the more problematic symptoms through lifestyle changes (getting 150 minutes of exercise a week and keeping a 'normal' bmi - note that a lower bmi than what's normal for your age and height isn't good either).

"I will say it took me a long time to get serious about my diet and I've been working on fixing my diet for about 3 years. I've made slow, sustainable changes. I started with cutting out sugar and counting my carbs, so I would still eat low carb tortillas etc. Then I did all flour and and sugar, and I did that for over a year, I just cut out artificial sugars a month ago (which was honestly the hardest lol I love me some diet Coke, rebel icecream and Lilly's chocolate). I will also add that I've struggled with compulsive eating (though I believe this is a side effect poor of insulin regulation from PCOS). So my eating style is based loosely on OA and bright line eating.   So I cook a lot and I have a lot of experience so that made the transition easier. I cook for my family of 4, 4-5 nights per week. When I cook I try to make enough leftovers for 2-3 lunches so my husband and I have lunch for the next day.  For me every meal is a protein and a veggie, I keep it very simple. I always make my family some kind of starch, potatoes, rice etc on the side. I've basically stopped making pasta for them because I realized how bad it is for everyone.   Breakfast: water (haha) but before I did IF I ate eggs every which way  Lunch: leftovers, hamburgers w/ veggies, fish w/veggies etc. If I'm on the go my go to is always 2-3 boiled eggs, 1-3oz cheese, 1-2oz nuts  Dinner: grilled chicken and asparagus, baked chicken and broccoli, chicken/beef fajitas, pork chops etc. I'm always looking for ways to eat more veggies and make it easier. I've started buying the packs of prepped fresh veggies from Walmart (I use their grocery pick up), so all I have to do is cook them. I've been eating a lot of brussel sprouts roasted in the air fryer and it's so delicious.   I try to avoid snacking because it's usually unnecessary calories...but if I do I eat peanuts, cheese, roasted edamame, boiled eggs.

"I'm not sure that it's fatphobia so much as they don't have a better idea. Most of the medical solutions for PCOS (metformin, spiro, birth control) aren't that great or all that healthy.  Dietary solutions can work well and have lasting positive impact if done properly. Whether you lose the weight or not is not as important as how you manage your insulin resistance, and that comes down to eating low carb. Most people eating low carb do lose weight, but it's possible not to if you eat more fat and protein than you burn daily.  Most people overeat in carbs though, so it's just not that likely.  I do think that doctors focusing on body fat instead of focusing on high insulin is not serving their patients well.  If doctors would explain that they can lower their blood glucose and insulin resistance with low carb, and patients will most likely lose weight while doing it, doctors would have a lot more success.  But telling patients to lose weight could end up in them going on a (high carb low calorie) slimfast type diet that will have basically the opposite results they want.  Honestly it took me being diagnosed with T2 Diabetes 4 years ago for me to learn this.

"Balancing your hormones will likely stop or at least hinder the continued the virilization of your body.

And these aspects are also very important, too.     I know it's tough to see the masculinizing effects of PCOS hormone imbalances on your body, especially when our culture has a very specific and objectifying view of what women ""should"" look like.     Also, remember that while trans women may identify as women, they aren't actually female. While some of the medication they take to feminize a male body may work for women with PCOS, male and female bodies are fundamentally different.  Trans women also typically adopt other aspects of what society categorizes as stereotypically ""feminine"" like makeup, clothing etc.      Remember, there's no missing female ""essence.""  There's just being female, and that manifests in three and a half billion different ways.",/r/PCOS/comments/f5wx5x/will_balancing_my_hormones_restore_my_female/fi1pkuw/,comment,2020-02-18 14:44:51-07:00

"The time in my life where I felt like I looked the most feminine was late high school when I was routinely working out. I think this success was three-fold:   1. Weight loss  - My face looking more feminine as I lost weight in my chin and my body took on a more feminine figure as I lost weight around my belly and my thighs.  2. Muscle Toning - Focusing on exercises that toned my legs, arms, and glutes did wonders for me. Even when I wasn't losing weight, my proportions became much more hour glass shaped.  3. Mental health - I was working out a lot of stress. And I really think it showed in my demeanor. I had less of a pinched, furrowed brow, my face was more open, I was quicker to smile and laugh. I felt good and it showed in my temperament, which I think aligned more with the societal idea of how a woman should look: happy, kind, and open to interactions with others.  &amp;#x200B;  Additionally, working out was the best way for me to balance my hormones naturally, I think.

"So, blood tests for PCOS are hard. Blood testosterone is often not high even if clinical hyperandrogenism is obvious with male-pattern hair growth.  This is because the testosterone may be in your tissues doing things but not in your blood stream (getting measured).  The diagnostic criteria for PCOS require either the physical evidence of hyperandrogenism or the blood test for this reason.    You didn't mention if you had irregular menstrual cycles or not.  Technically that plus high follicular count in ultrasound can be enough for diagnosis.  Insulin resistance is not a diagnostic criteria.  But in addition, insulin resistance is difficult to properly test for.  Normal a1c and normal fasting glucose does not exclude insulin resistance.  The best way is to do a oral glucose tolerance test, and measure insulin and glucose in response to the test.  If she didn't do this (or measure fasting insulin a number of times) she didn't actually exclude insulin resistance.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;She said a lot of people have markers but don’t have the syndrome.

"I offer no solutions, only to commiserate. I had two periods when I was in 7th grade then no more.   When I was 16, my mom made me an appointment with a gyno, I was put on a round of provera to start my period then put in hormonal birth control. I had regular periods from that until I stopped BC in my early 20s. After that I had a complete lack of period. I had no health insurance so I finally went to Planned Parenthood for an exam and I was diagnosed with PCOS. I started provera again.   I couldn’t take hormonal bc anymore because I have an elevated risk for stroke. I would take provers every ~3 months, have a period, then have a lighter period around a month later.   I started taking myoinositol and my periods became regular albeit light. That has been working for me for a couple years.

Do that for about a week or until your side effects feel manageable. I felt sick for many days and hardly had an appetite for the first week. (I took gravol a few times to be able to get through my work day.  You could try immodium for diarrhea). Then start taking 1/2 a tablet in the morning in addition to the whole one in the evening, and finally, take the one tablet in the morning and the one at night. Call your pharmacist or doctor to have them confirm this is okay for you! (I can't see why it wouldn't be, but I know for myself I would be more comfortable hearing it from a healthcare professional). If this doesn't work, you can ask to try the extended release version as someone else mentioned.  I've been on it nearly a month and now am at 1000mg/day as prescribed.

"First: fatphobia in medical settings is absolutely a thing. You're smart to be questioning authority because doctors are humans too. No one is immune to systemic bias. The truth is, in most areas, it isn't really clear if fatness is the problem or if its other lifestyle things. [What we do know is](https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/diets-do-not-work-the-thin-evidence-that-losing-weight-makes-you-healthier.amp) that cyclical weight gain and loss can cause more damage than just being fat.   Second: yes, weightloss and moderate exercise does help with PCOS. Many find that low carb diets specifically help, but that isn't observed in the research (basically, do what works for you).

"I know exactly how stressful it can be monitoring your cycle and having weird bleeding. remember that you are essentially resetting your entire metabolism and by extension your hormones. there's a lot of processes that probably have not worked correctly in a long time, and now they're firing back up. it's a good thing, but it's a pain in the ass and definitely feels weird in the beginning! low carb/keto diets are *notorious* for causing funky bleeding (really heavy periods or really light periods or mid-cycle spotting) at first. even women without PCOS can have issues. weight loss itself can also cause hormonal issues because your fat cells release a lot of stored hormones into your blood stream when they are ""burned.""   remember that the ""I started keto and 2 weeks later I was pregnant"" stories are outliers. for most women that is not the case. keto usually takes 3-4 cycles before things start to normalize. it's certainly been the case with me! my first keto period came right on time but even though I'd had a few medically induced periods in the months prior it was also really, alarmingly heavy. the second one was more normal, but there was some spotting in between. this third cycle there has been no spotting (fingers crossed.)   it gets better, I promise! your body is healing and healing takes time.",/r/PCOS/comments/f5tssq/sometimes_i_wonder_if_everything_is_in_my_head/fi0rdcg/,comment,2020-02-18 09:26:55-07:00

"the glycemic index denotes a food's effects on blood sugar. it was developed to help control diabetes and eventually co-opted for weight loss. it is definitely an improvement on the SAD.   BUT our problem with PCOS is insulin. insulin and blood glucose are two different metrics with insulin being somewhat less understood. just because a food causes only a modest blood glucose spike doesn't mean it doesn't cause a massive *insulin* spike.   that said, for many women a low GI diet gets them great results. at the very least it's a good way to start a PCOS lifestyle regimen. at the end of the day we are all our own sample size of 1 and we have to figure out what works for our symptoms while fitting into our lifestyle. for me personally, switching to brown rice and whole grains did nothing for my symptoms and I had to cut down carbs more broadly.",/r/PCOS/comments/f5lcry/low_carb_vs_low_glycemic_diet/fi0hxya/,comment,2020-02-18 07:49:53-07:00

However, feeling disgust for yourself based on the number of kilos, to me, means there is a a deep rooted issue with your self love. It's not uncommon.  I wish you will be able to lose the weight asap, but it can take a long time with PCOS and it can also come back.

"This might be an unpopular opinion on here, but definitely think it could be fatphobia. There are lots of studies showing that doctors perpetuate weight stigma (bc they’re fatphobic) which is harmful to health. I don’t love that doctors suggest weight loss to most people with PCOS when the long term weight loss research is questionable. Symptoms could improve with weight loss—true. But I think about what a doctor would suggest to someone in a smaller body—more movement, more vegetables, supplements, whatever—and think that route is promising because it’s more sustainable for me. I told my OBGYN that I don’t want weight to be the focus (or even a focus at all) because of my eating disorder history and she was more agreeable than I expected. She suggested several things that she would suggest to anyone regardless of size and they’re not related to weight loss. Not everything works for everyone, and for me, being told to lose weight by doctors in the past has been damaging. It felt really good to be honest about how that doesn’t work for me—if I lose weight from the changes I make, so be it, but I’m not going to focus on that so I can preserve my mental health.",/r/PCOS/comments/f5lsce/dr_told_me_if_i_lose_weight_i_can_reverse_pcosis/fi0b2o5/,comment,2020-02-18 06:25:56-07:00

"I am a woman with PCOS and a woman who loves women (...too, I'm bi).  It took me a while to adjust to my much bigger body, but porn featuring BBWs was cool to watch for reference and I was lucky to have a boyfriend at the time: sex did not stop, he did not stop wanting me, when I gained 18kg. You don't seem to have this option but let me tell you it exists, so men like us in all shapes and sizes.  I still struggled with my body and being with women was very liberating on that front: they did not care, not about all the fat or the body hair. And I realised I don't care. And I love all bodies but there is a specific excitement to bigger girls, I feel I have been gifted with more to love, more to enjoy, more to admire. And I now consider myself this kind of gift too.  Size in and of itself does not make a person attractive or not. It's a factor, but the smile, the energy of that person, their laugh, the way we interact, come first. Granted, men tend to be more visual, but they feel everything I described too.  Try making yourself sexy for you. Buy lingerie you like and massage your breast in the mirror, slap your ass. Acknowledge the hump on your neck exists and you don't like it, but just let it be and focus on the rest of you.  Also, dip your toe in the water. I had not been having sex for a long time because I was constantly bleeding from PCOS and didn't want to test new partners like that. At some point I got fed up and went on Tinder. After some filtering and chatting I found a great guy (he is also fucking hot a Middle Eastern swimming champion.......) who does not care. We are Friends with Benefits now and we just use condoms and a towel when I'm bleeding. I even had my first threesome with him and a friend. And I am a hairy, big, bloody girl.  The first time I had sex with him I felt so shy but then my old self resurfaced and...I'm still sexy as hell, I'm still a very sexual person.  Don't let your new body stop you. It is the one you get to use now. What if tomorrow you can't have sex anymore, at all? Wouldn't it have been a shame not to try now?  I would ask you out but I am sure you are very far away. Know you are gorgeous and that there is plenty of room for you to get back in the sack.

"Losing weight definitely can lessen the impact of your pcos, but I dont think it's so much the weight that does it, but the diet you have to eat to lose the weight is where the magic actually happens. There are plenty of thin women who struggle with severe pcos (I beleive they call that ""lean pcos""), and although they are already skinny, they still have to follow a specific diet to lessen their symptoms. I'd say weight loss isnt the main goal, it's just a bonus to eating healthy. Or at least, this is how my doctor explained it to me, I absolutely love her. I think if more doctors explained it this way, it would feel less like an attack on our appearance and more like they're just giving us health advice.

As soon as I eat like crap and gain weight, my periods are nasty and irregular again. I only got tested after 8 months of weight loss and my hormones were normal, but since I have nothing to compare to, that's not relevant. I have mild PCOS symptoms and cysts, but my doctor told me to keep losing weight and try to combat the symptoms naturally instead of going on BC. From a person who has been obese most of their life, I can wholeheartedly admit that life is so much better without carrying all that excess weight, PCOS or not. I'm all for body positivity, but I'm also all in for a healthy lifestyle. I watched an autopsy on an obese woman on YT and it really shifted my perspective. I still have a long way to go, but I don't want to ever go back to that dark place. If you want to make a change, you're doing your future self a favour.

"Check to see what is available through your college. At mine, all students and staff get free access to the gym, so that's the first hurdle. Some classes are free too. When I was in university, we could take classes pretty cheap, like $50 for a semester of yoga classes. Community centres are also a great place to look for free or cheap classes.  If you don't have a lot of experience with fitness, I would suggest trying a number of classes or YouTube videos to see what you like. I used to run but I hated cardio and never felt like I was making enough progress. Now I lift weights and I come out of it feeling strong and amazing. I also do yoga and pilates.. sometimes it's intense (especially pilates) and sometimes its not, but it's a free class through my nearest community centre so all I have to do is show up.   I really like classes, personally. You can track your progression but don't have to give much thought to what you're doing. If you find something you really love, you might grow out of the class as you need to up it past what the class offers, but as you zero in on what works for you, you'll be motivated by your personal practice.

"Unfortunately endocrinic disorders are often an egg/chicken coming first story. Insulin can most definitely disrupt hormone signals, but hormones also affect metabolism and glucose tolerance....  We (as health care providers) strive have a definitive understanding of each patient presentation, so we can recommend more tailored responses. In your case, it sounds like it definitely is a hyperonsilinemia cause where despite your healthy BMI, the high levels of insulin is causing the disproportionate levels of testosterone/androgens. I agree a ketogenic diet, intermittent diet and insulin sensitizing drugs (metformin) is the best approach :)   There are unfortunately women who have lower levels of aromatase (the hormone that converts testosterone to become estrogen) which has been linked to higher risk for insulin insensitivity thus diabetes.

"Meat eaters are not trying to find any excuse to eat meat.   Did you know that it takes 122 gallons of water to produce 1lb of grass fed beef but 1lb corn - 309 gallons, 1lb tofu - 302, 1lb rice - 299, 1lb almonds - 1929? So the water footprint for meat isn't as crazy as the lie vegans/vegetarians claim.   Animal cruelty? Don't buy cheap meat as to avoid factory farming meats.   Heard of monocrops? Major crops that are grown as a monoculture are usually grains like corn, wheat, soy and rice, single species fruit, even vegetable crops and also cotton. Planting the same crop in the same place each year zaps nutrients from the earth and leaves soil weak and unable to support healthy plant growth. Because soil structure and quality is so poor, farmers are forced to use chemical fertilizers to encourage plant growth and fruit production. These fertilizers, in turn, disrupt the natural makeup of the soil and contribute further to nutrient depletion. Monocropping also creates the spread of pests and diseases, which must be treated with yet more chemicals. The effects of monocropping on the environment are severe when pesticides and fertilizers make their way into ground water or become airborne, creating pollution.    And this is just a teeny amount on information why vegans and vegetarians aren't holier than thou and meat eaters aren't just looking for any excuse to eat meat.   Eat whatever you like and whatever suits your GUT but always do your research. Buy local and organic where possible, free range and grass fed if looking for an excuse to eat meat is your thing too.

Natural Cycles uses your basal body temperature. You take your temperature every morning and log it in the app. It’s a contraceptive app but also gives me a reassurance I’m ovulating. The app prediction is very good because it uses your own body’s indication which can vary from cycle to another. I’ve used it for more than 2 years and had only 1-2 situations where my period wasn’t on the same day as initially predicted but if I temp that day it  can always tell in the morning if my period is due today so I’m  prepared.

"I was officially diagnosed in May of last year although I’ve really had the symptoms for about 3 years now.  I did talk to a doctor about it but unfortunately I moved and now I’m searching for a doctor who actually specializes in PCOS. My other doctor didn’t know much at all about it.  I have tried BC and spironolactone but had to get off of it because it made things worse for me and made my moods worse. I have been on a keto diet which didn’t do much. I’ve tried different creams and medications for my acne which did nothing. I’ve tried Nizoral, biotin, Nioxin, prenatal vitamins, hair skin and nail vitamins and many other vitamins to try and get my hair back to normal.  Really the other symptoms don’t bother me that much, it’s really mostly the acne and severe hair loss. It’s destroyed my self esteem and my ex left me over it.

One think that I think is very important for keeping your skin clear and free of whiteheads, ingrown hairs, and other blemishes, is to make sure you exfoliate.

"It sounds like you already meet two of the three criteria for PCOS: ovarian cyst, irregular periods and/or abnormal hormones.  The last is tested with blood work.  And if you've tracked your period, you can bring that info with you as well (helped me establish I have long cycles that are considered to long).    You can also look up lean PCOS since not all women with PCOS are overweight which it sounds like you aren't.

"YES! I was diagnosed 9 years ago when I was 14 and I was told the same thing over and over: take BC and diet. Well I did those, didn’t lose weight, ended up piling on 50lbs out of nowhere when I was 19. Every doctor I went to humiliated me about my weight and none of them took my condition seriously. It got so bad that I stopped taking my bc because it made me feel awful, and I stopped having periods altogether.  After years of neglecting myself and refusing to see doctors, I decided to go low carb. I was low carb for AN ENTIRE YEAR and didn’t lose a single pound! That was a wake up call for me. I decided that I’ve had enough, that I was going to seek medical care and if any doctor gave me shit about my weight, especially without addressing my problems, I’ll tell em to go to hell.  Luckily, I found an amazing physician who has been very understanding and sympathetic of my conditions. She reassured me that this is a common thing that 1 in 5 women suffer through, and she sat there and explained why my body is the way it is. She had me take blood tests to see if I had insulin resistance, and sure enough I did.  Right then, she put me on Metformin to help my insulin levels, put me on Provera to induce periods and even prescribed me Wellbutrin to help with my anxiety and depression. I saw her last month and have now started Yaz birth control to regulate my cycle so no more Provera! To my surprise, I even lost 40lbs since last March, and she congratulated me and told it’s because we have gotten a hold of my insulin issue.   PCOS is hard enough as it is but I feel like I can handle it when there’s a doctor that’s actually on my side.",/r/PCOS/comments/f52x22/i_was_diagnosed_with_pcos_decades_ago_why_am_i/fhyp10b/,comment,2020-02-17 16:02:53-07:00

"Lots of good questions. Keto has worked really well for me and I enjoy the foods. IF has been good too. 36 hour fasts have been easy. A lot of symptoms like inflammation are dramatically better, no more Achilles pain, carpal tunnel or twinges in a knee I hurt skiing years ago. I do think symptoms overall are better. I have also incorporated spearmint tea twice a day and that has really helped as well.   I just do not want to be working against my goals, I guess, with fasting that is --too long--? It was a post on here that said the recs were mixed re: PCOS (think it had to do with duration). Then I just saw an article by Megan Ramos re: 30 hour fasts, that said it was not recommended if you have PCOS. I think I will keep to OMAD or single day fasts for now but would love to find out more. But, like you said, I am my own sample size.

I went through an extremely stressful time a few years ago and gained a lot of weight quickly and became more apple shaped suddenly and symptoms were worse than ever.

"Not OP but I am a fairly experienced weightlifter after doing it for 5+ years at home and in a gym.  The main advice I would give:  * Get a trainer in a gym to teach you proper form. This will be invaluable, you can waste a lot of time and hurt yourself pretty badly with poor form.  * Once you learn you can carry on by yourself, and even at home if you can buy some basic dumbbells. * Don't be intimidated by other people in the gym. Nobody cares about your workout - they are focusing on their own. * Stretch well before and after. Do dynamic stretches to warm up your muscles before. * Focus on compound lifts that use lots of your body at once. These will be the best use of your time and get your blood pumping. Compound lifts include lunges, squats and deadlifts.  * Start with low weights and progress regularly. You should be struggling to continue lifting after 8-10 reps. If you can bust out 1000 repetitions then you are not using enough weight. * Keep your workouts simple. 30-45 minutes is plenty. * Bodyweight exercises can be very powerful. These might be press ups, sit ups, squats etc. You might want to start with these before adding any weight. * Make sure to give your body adequate fuel and rest time. Eat some protein within 20 minutes of lifting to help your body build muscle. Give yourself a few rest days every week. * It is a very slow but gratifying process. Make the most of the additional testosterone we have and use it to grow stronger and stronger.

"you are not having periods because you are not ovulating: ovulation is the hormonal trigger that causes a period 2 weeks later if conception doesn't occur. some women still have periods despite not ovulating but many are like you.  it is absolutely possible to get pregnant with PCOS. once ovulation is either resumed or triggered with medication our bodies function as normal. it's *possible* you could spontaneously ovulate, its not unheard of, but it's not likely if it's been 2 years. if you want to get pregnant you should probably look into some weight loss (if you're overweight,) diet changes (if you consume a lot of sugar and processed food,) inositol, and metformin if your doctor is willing to prescribe. that is often enough to resume normal cycling but if not there are a variety of fertility treatments available.",/r/PCOS/comments/f5gl7s/conceiving_without_periods/fhykmd6/,comment,2020-02-17 15:17:33-07:00

"Almost all fertility doctors treat TSH above 2.5 (even though outside of fertility it's questionable between 2.5 and 5), if fertility is your concern.  If it's not then I wouldn't worry much about the TSH, although high carb diet and hypothyroidism do tend to go together, so your TSH may improve with adding more protein fat and slightly decreasing your carbs. (Obviously be really careful there as you're already at a good BMI and shouldn't be cutting calories with the amount of exercise you do.)  Progesterone units must be different from normal, usually it's about 1/10 of that.  So yeah, not a concern.

"If you show no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (hair growth on face or chest, acne, hydranitis suppurativa, etc) and your androgens are normal, then odds of it being PCOS itself isn't very good, regardless of what the ultrasound says. Non-PCOS women frequently have polycystic ovaries, and PCOS women often have normal ovaries.  What I do notice is that your a1c is a bit on the high side (5.5 is pre-diabetic).  Your TSH is on the high side (fertility clinics tend to treat at 2.5).  You may have slight non-alcoholic fatty liver if your liver enzymes are elevated, which is very very common these days.  Your progesterone is rather high (assuming the units are the typical) which at the least indicates you ovulated in the last two weeks. Have you taken a pregnancy test?  If you've confirmed you are not pregnant then your progesterone levels could suggest another condition such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia.    You didn't mention your age, but it might be worth getting an amh test to rule out premature ovarian failure as a cause of your irregular cycles.  I don't see anything about your BMI or exercise, but if you have low BMI or exercise a lot then there are other possible explanations such as hypothalamic amenorrhea.    There are also other things that can cause menstrual irregularities such as a very unbalanced diet or daily use of marijuana, which can suppress the hormones that drive your cycle.  It looks like your doctor has already eliminated hyperprolactinemia which is good.   Hope that helps.",/r/PCOS/comments/f5ep8d/lab_results/fhy97zj/,comment,2020-02-17 13:27:06-07:00

"While that’s true, there are papers that suggest hyperandrogeneism itself induces glucose-induced inflammatory responses AND a diet-induced inflammation increasing levels of testosterone (Steroids, Gonzalez, 2012). I guess tertiary is not the right word lol but I think a more complete explanation to weight-gain tendencies in women with PCOS is that an inherently high androgen level can induce an insulin-resistant response, which causes high levels of insulin detected in the ovaries, which then causes even higher levels of androgens. It’s a vicious positive feedback cycle.   Regardless, I agree with you that the most reasonable  solution is to keep insulin levels low — while metformin helps, the best first line of treatment should always be conscious dietary changes!",/r/PCOS/comments/f52x22/i_was_diagnosed_with_pcos_decades_ago_why_am_i/fhxvpw4/,comment,2020-02-17 11:15:02-07:00

"Yeah, you have ""research"" indeed -- ""We compared the effect of a pulse-based diet to the NCEP TLC diet on  cardio-metabolic disease risk measures in reproductive-age women with  PCOS, for 16 weeks without energy restriction, when the **diets were  combined with aerobic exercise and health counselling**.""  That's called a confounder (go look it up) and they cannot make a claim that the diet alone did anything -- it might all be the exercise and health counseling.  They also randomized poorly.  Fasting insulin declined 4 (µIU/mL) but the other group declined 3 (µIU/mL) so did the pulses and ""plant based"" foods even matter?  No, they did not.  Comparing them further against the paper I cited, ""Our findings are similar to a previous clinical series of the use of a  low (100 gram/d) carbohydrate, high saturated fat diet in 15 women with  PCOS \[[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1334192/#B21)\].  In that study, there was a 14.3 percent reduction in body weight (p =  0.008) and a reduction in fasting serum insulin from 24.2 μIU/ml to 12.2  μIU/ml from baseline to 24 weeks (p &lt; 0.005). In our study, there  was a 12.1% reduction in body weight (p = 0.006), and a reduction in  insulin from 23.5 μIU/ml to 8.2 μIU/ml (p = 0.002). Taken together,  these two clinical series support that formal research be directed  toward carbohydrate restriction and PCOS.""  Meaning keto beats the socks off your ""plant based"" diet of lentils.

"I don’t have kids yet and we’re not trying at the moment but my husband really wants them. Before we got married, I went to a gyno and an endo to have a whole bunch of tests done and they both confirmed that all having PCOS would mean for me was that I’d be at higher risk for miscarriage during the first trimester then the average woman is. They both seemed confident that I’d be able to conceive successfully whenever I was ready.   I also have another friend with PCOS who has a child and had no issues conceiving. PCOS doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t conceive or even that it’ll be harder to conceive.   Talk to your gyno about what it means for you to try to conviene with PCOS and any other possible reasons you might be struggling to conceive, get an endocrinologist if you don’t already have one and get an official diagnosis/talk to them about what it might mean to try to conceive with PCOS.  There are lots of people who have a hard time conceiving and they don’t all have PCOS. Sometimes it’s as simple as stress/pressure messing with people. As an anecdote, I have a friend who tried for 7 years to have a child. Eventually she ended up adopting, all the stress/pressure was relieved, and she naturally conceived just 1 year after bringing her adopted baby home.   TLDR: Everyone is different, talk to your doctors about what possibly having PCOS means for you and your journey to having a child. Purely anecdotally, I haven’t known it to be an issue and there are other reasons people struggle to conceive.",/r/PCOS/comments/f59zm8/how_did_you_conceive_with_pcos/fhxfco2/,comment,2020-02-17 08:24:21-07:00

"No, it truly works the other way round.  Ovaries have receptors for insulin (I think to be able to check if a woman's body takes in enough energy to be able to carry a pregnancy). They also produce testosterone, and if the insulin remains too high because the body has an insulin resistance, they are steeped in it and over-produce testosterone. The result is the typical visible things like male-pattern hair growth, muscle development and overall distribution of weight, hair loss etc., and (if I understood this right) also a thickening of the ovaries' walls, which interferes with ovulation.  So keeping insulin low is the primary way to *actually* treat PCOS (not sure about lean PCOS, the factors and treatment may vary there somewhat, but I haven't learned about that yet). Some people can do so through diet alone, others, like me, need Metformin (or Berberine) in addition to that. Apparently using both in conjunction gets the best results, I currently don't have the capacity for a huge diet switch, and am only taking Metformin.  I lived very low-carb for almost half a year a few years ago, before I knew about the connection between insulin and PCOS, but that had no effect on it, so at least for me, I know I do need medication.",/r/PCOS/comments/f52x22/i_was_diagnosed_with_pcos_decades_ago_why_am_i/fhx736b/,comment,2020-02-17 06:38:31-07:00

The pill for PCOS is useless, and ironically, the moment women stop taking it, for example to actually become pregnant, the positive effects and thus the cosmetic appearance of regular periods stop and along with it come the usual problems of missing ovulation and difficulty becoming pregnant.

"You're mixing things up a little. Insulin resistance isn't a tertiary effect, in most cases it's the *cause* of PCOS. Treating it with Metformin is, apart from drastically reducing carbs, pretty much the only way to treat it, and prescribing it is actually treating PCOS. Very different from prescribing the pill.  The pill however truly only addresses the symptoms of PCOS, but does nothing to treat it or the underlying insulin resistance which actually is the thing that needs treating, since the resistance wreaks havoc in the body apart from the PCOS, too. The pill is useless for that, only does cosmetic improvements, and comes with its own huge set of problems, so giving it just for PCOS is plain bullshit.",/r/PCOS/comments/f52x22/i_was_diagnosed_with_pcos_decades_ago_why_am_i/fhwxrws/,comment,2020-02-17 03:35:56-07:00

"Love mine. I’ve had it done at a plastic surgeon’s office (most expensive for full face/neck at $~2500 for monthly treatments 15 years ago and then 10 years ago at a 50% discount). My “beard” hair tended to grow back in 4-5 year cycles and 5 years ago it started growing back. It is really dark, and plucking and waxing just don’t cut it. I had seen Groupons for a medspa to do that area for 6 sessions at $100, so I decided to give it a try.   Within a year, it was back. Went to a dermatologist office that year and it was clear for a year and came back. So, during a 20% off sale at Sephora 2 years ago, I took the plunge and got the IPL machine that they were selling. Used it weekly for about 5 or 6 sessions, did a couple of touch ups, and it’s been sitting on a shelf collecting dust until it needs to come back out whenever the new follicles activate.  It can be an expensive investment upfront, but in the long run it turns out to be a better deal.

"For me, each change (getting pregnant, delivery, stopping nursing) was like a mini-puberty all over again. Weight fluctuations, acne, hair changes, you name it. Before my first child I was on a BC pill I *loved*. I felt normal and healthy for the first time since puberty.  Found out, however, that most hormonal estrogen is a terrible idea for me because of blood clotting issues. I used the copper iud for a year and *hated* it. After my second was born I used Mirena (low enough hormone dose to be safe for me) and I really like it. My hormonal issues weren’t as neatly dealt with as with the pill, but I had a semi-regular period with only a day of bleeding, and fewer other pms symptoms. I nursed for about 13 months and gained ALL my pregnancy weight back during that time, had another puberty when I stopped, and then another again about 6 months later when I had my iud removed. I’m pregnant again now and am kind of excited for, like, 2 years from now when I can be done with the regular fluctuations and find a new normal.

"Not sure on those readings. You might want to get a second opinion on your bloodwork just in case?  Metformin is to help regulate your blood sugar. Even if your fasting results are normal, it can reduce spikes you get after meals. My fasting sugars are normal too, but it takes a while for them to go down - eg 4 hours instead of 2, and too many carbs can throw me in the 160-200 range easily.  Also, producing more insulin can create a feedback loop with testosterone, affecting hormones or causing weight gain.  RE cholesterol - I’ve read that eating more good cholesterol - fish, avocado, nuts, good olive oil - can reduce the amount of bad cholesterol. Apparently, not getting enough good cholesterol can make your body produce more bad cholesterol but I don’t have a source on that so take it with a grain of salt.   That and higher fiber. High fiber clears out bad cholesterol as well. I def eat too much meat - even if it is less fatty meat - to compensate for fewer carbs and my bad cholesterols always come back a little elevated as a result. If food does not fix it, you might have to look into different options, though. Best of luck!",/r/PCOS/comments/f42do8/diagnosed_with_pcos_and_thats_it/fhwecln/,comment,2020-02-16 21:24:41-07:00

After we broke up (for many unrelated reasons to PCOS) I got into electrolysis and it’s been a game changer.   I did date a guy briefly a few years ago that was in general demeaning to women. Sometimes he would bring up certain areas I had hair. My current bf has never noticed. Douche brief bf would make comments that were rude. Not just joking. But I could tell he had really low confidence. I was 11 years younger, moving up quick in my career, and he had kids and I didn’t. He was very bitter and divorcing and had a chip on his shoulder. He was bald to and I never made fun of him for it (atleast body hair you can get rid of, head hair is another story). He was very “stuck” at where he was in life.

"&gt; Okay then, since the advice we’ve all been given from our doctors is wrong  Can you explain to me why do you think you know that all women with PCOS are given the advice to cut carbohydrate from their diet? Just because this is your experience? You've this bad habit of extrapolating your experience to everyone.  Where do you live anyway? Perhaps you simply live in a place where people eat a lot of meat. Many doctors don't know anything about nutrition and they can't see beyond their dining plate. They recommend steaks to you because they're eating steaks.  So let's focus on published evidence, shall we? This way at least we can cite names and written statements. I think this article provides a decent summary of the current published evidence: https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/19/5/432/611716  &gt; and you’re right, please explain how eating more carbohydrates helps PCOS.  It's explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWiiEIh2e_8. Carbohydrates restore insulin sensitivity and they allow normalization of insulin levels. You can also normalize your insulin levels by fully depriving your body of carbohydrates. But this will cause other problems and it causes a lot of different problems down the road.  &gt;PCOS is an endocrinological disorder where women have an excess production of androgens and testosterone.  According to some diagnostic criteria, yes, according to other criteria, no: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome#Definition  &gt;As a result, women may experience cystic ovaries from the failure of the follicles in our ovaries to fully develop due to an over presence of androgens. Woman may experience abnormal hair growth and male pattern baldness due to an excess production of testosterone. Woman may experience oily skin and deep cystic acne because of their hormone imbalances.   I'm not expert on PCOS and I can't confirm or deny this. From my limited understanding of the disease, there are multiple hormones that are alterated.  &gt;And yes, those chronic hormone imbalances can also cause decreased sensitivity to the HORMONE, insulin.   I would argue insulin resistance (which in itself is a vague concept btw) comes first.  &gt;Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that is secreted whenever we eat carbohydrates. The job of insulin is to make it possible our tissues to absorb the sugars and amino acids found in carbohydrates and to convert them into energy. Insulin is also the hormone that triggers fat storage, which it does when there is an excess of sugars, fats, and proteins that cannot be converted to energy.  It's more complex than this but OK, you're very vaguely correct here.  &gt;When you are Insulin resistant, that means that your body doesn’t respond to the insulin that is attempting to break down the sugar and acids in carbohydrates so that they can be absorbed by your muscles and tissues. Instead, those sugars enter your blood stream, which is called Hyperglycemia. When you have high blood sugar, your body’s natural response (like an immune response) is to release more insulin— which in people who are insulin resistant, exacerbates the problem. It’s why diabetics can’t have sugar and have to live on a low carb/low glycemic index diet, because they don’t produce insulin so their bodies can’t break it down and it instead enters their blood stream. Same thing with PCOS except it’s not that our bodies aren’t producing insulin, our bodies aren’t responding to insulin.   I think it's bizarre you think insulin is an immune response. This is clearly the point of view of obese fad dieters that are put on low carb diets. It's just bizarre.  Sugar and carbohydrates cure this problem. You can cure insulin resistance and diabetes by eating more carbohydrates. This has been demonstrated over and over again in the last 100 years. The video above covers all the studies on this.   &gt;Now the crux of your whole “cure your PCOS by curing your insulin resistance” theory is that only 30%-40% of people with PCOS are insulin resistant in the first place.  I would love to see references for this. It's also rather vague because insulin resistance is a rather vague concept. I've never said all PCOS are due to insulin resistance, although this could be true. I'm not taking a stance in either direction on this.  &gt;So stop, you don’t know what you’re talking about.  I would say you've to stop.",/r/PCOS/comments/f4nhng/going_from_slighty_overweight_to_ideal_weight_is/fhushcj/,comment,2020-02-16 14:48:38-07:00

"CICO works, slowly for folks like us with hormone disruption.  I didn't have to go KETO, just figure out what my normal intake should be and go below that.  Worked for three weeks out of four (thanks, hormones, yeesh).   The data says that the slower it works the longer it works.  Apparently this is because slowly reducing total body weight means your metabolic rate isn't depressed as much.  People who lose weight fast have a concurrent drop in the BMR that means they're more likely to yo-yo: diet to lose, so much easier to gain afterwards.

"I've used CICO before, and it works wonders *once you know your actual TDEE* - which is the hardest part. A good rule of thumb for those of us with PCOS is that our maintenance calories is about 85% of what most online calculators will say - which means that our calorie limit for weight *loss* is even lower. So, for example, if the calculators say you need about 1400cal/day to lose at X rate, make sure to add that PCOS modifier - it knocks your caloric budget down to 1200/day for X rate.   I lost 70lbs a couple of years back once I figured out how wrong the counts were, and never regretted it. If you have to go below 1000-1200 calories a day for weight loss, you'll need to make the deficit from exercise, not food.",/r/PCOS/comments/f4sr6q/does_cico_work_well/fhua4kg/,comment,2020-02-16 13:12:03-07:00

"It's totally possible you have PCOS.  When I was diagnosed, I had been trying to get pregnant for 1.5 years.  I've never been on birth control so don't know how long it takes for cycle to happen when you get off it.  My cycles are long (average 35-36 days) and had a few cycles skip.  When I met my obgyn for the first time, she did an ultrasound for cysts when I have on both ovaries.  She also had me do blood work on the third day of my next cycle (which I had to wait for a cycle to start so that took a few weeks).  That showed I did have some higher hormones though my testerone was normal.  I also do have acne my whole life as well as overweight. My long cycles, cysts, and high hormones lead my doc to diagnose me with PCOS.   The criteria to diagnose PCOS needs you to meet two of the three markers: ovarian cysts, abnormal hormones (usually male hormones) and irregular periods.  One of the treatments is actually birth control since it helps regulate the cycle and some hormones.  There are some treatments that also help.  And some women find making diet changes help with the symptoms as well (keto or low carb diet).  That is linked with the insulin resistance which many PCOS women have.

"I feel like their entire idea of insulin resistance is wrong.   Insulin is a hormone that is excreted from the Pancreas which allows our bodies to break down carbohydrates and convert the sugars and amino acids that are present in carbohydrates into energy. Insulin is also the the hormone that stores fat.  Insulin resistance means that your body is unable to process insulin properly, which means that you aren’t absorbing the sugars and amino acids present in carbohydrates and instead are storing all of that potential energy as excess fat. It can also mean that your blood sugar can run high, because your tissues aren’t absorbing sugars.   What happens when your blood sugar gets high? Your body produces more insulin, which you’re resistant to, which makes you store more fat, raises your blood sugar again or higher, and makes you produce more insulin.  This is why Keto works for PCOS. Because not eating carbohydrates makes it so that your body stops over producing insulin and instead relies on your body’s ability to break down and synthesize fats, which doesn’t require insulin. It requires ketones, which is what causes Ketosis.   Metformin is a diabetic drug that increases your body’s sensitivity to insulin, which is why it is prescribed to PCOS patients.   I don’t find Keto sustainable, so I choose intermittent fasting (which controls your body’s insulin production) and being aware of how what I’m eating makes my body feel. But the answer to helping your PCOS is definitely NOT eat MORE carbohydrates.",/r/PCOS/comments/f4nhng/going_from_slighty_overweight_to_ideal_weight_is/fhthmsm/,comment,2020-02-16 10:34:53-07:00

"I realize this is like a week old. Just chiming in because my **DHEA-S and androstenedione are the ONLY things elevated**. Other people struggling to identify if it is adrenal PCOS or NCAH (Nonclassic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia) may have elevated 17-OH Progesterone (a precursor to DHEA-S and androstenedione). My testosterone is **low.** DHEA-S/androstenedione are produced by adrenals, while testosterone is produced by ovaries. From what I have been told by my specialist, if you have high T, its pretty definitively PCOS (PCOS is a metabolic disorder, so you don't have to have cysts. They really should get on changing the name.) My doc is moving forward in determining if I have adrenal PCOS or NCAH, but it's because my only elevated androgens are adrenal. I hope that makes sense. I am not a doc or expert, but this explanation made sense to me. The symptoms you list are classic for PCOS. Free testosterone is what is elevated in PCOS. ""Free"" just means its the T thats floating around, ready to do things in the body. ""Total"" includes T that is bound to things, so it's not doing as much. At least that's how I understand it!   &amp;#x200B;  FWIW the symptoms I have are ONLY: infertility (trying to conceive for 4 years), some cystic acne, difficulty losing weight.

I say this as some with tuberous breasts myself and as a former bra fitter for Nordstrom so I've seen breasts of ALL shapes and sizes. What works best: while it may not be exactly what you want, soft cup bras really fit the best. You aren't having to fight against a premade molded cup that is designed for a fuller breast. If you're worried about nipple show through, silicone nipple covers solve that problem easily. If you're thoroughly opposed to soft cup bras though, brands like Natori really make great molded cup bras for women who are a shallow fit.

"Yeah me too. My hair has just been through a shedding phase and now it is really thin around the top and temples. It was quite distressing seeing my hair all over the floor, my clothes etc. But I think I have found the trigger this time and it seems to have stopped shedding so here's hoping it starts growing back soon.   Are you doing anything in terms of PCOS management? If you're insulin resistant, then getting that under control can help most/all of your PCOS symptoms in my experience. For me, that means low carb/keto diet, regular exercising (running &amp; team sport), and 1000mg metformin. I also use ketoconazole shampoo everyday. In addition, look out for potentially insulemic foods in your diet, this may even include some types of low calorie sweeteners. In my case, diet coke is fine, but monkfruit powder seems to have been the cause of my recent shed and the shedding stopped when I stopped using the monkfruit powder.

"Hi! It is possible to lose A LOT of weight. You just need perseverance. I’ve had PCOS since I was 14 and I’m 23 now, I’ve always been overweight but dismissed it to be baby fat.   Back in August 2019, I was at my heaviest at 188 pounds and I had enough after a visit to the endocrinologist who wanted me to go on the pill to regulate my periods however I knew the risks and side effects so I decided to tackle naturally. I started exercising for a good few months and in December, I was 173 pounds so I lost a good 15 pounds in 3/4 months.   So then I decided to do keto which was the best decision I’ve ever made. Currently I’m 162 pounds so lost 11 pounds in less than 2 months and everyone can see a huge difference in me. I feel amazing because even though I can’t see a physical difference, my clothes are visibly bigger plus my periods have started to regulate. Before, I used to get a period every 3-4 months but since November 2019, I’ve had them monthly. Keto is easy and it works for me however it might not work for someone else - you just cut out all cabs and increase your protein and fat intake. It helps balance insulin which is key to be fat when you have PCOS.   You can lose weight and it might be harder for us but if you persevere, it’ll be worth every effort you’ve put in!",/r/PCOS/comments/f4nhng/going_from_slighty_overweight_to_ideal_weight_is/fhs1np6/,comment,2020-02-16 03:35:41-07:00

"I felt the same way before I started shaving. A lot of it was worry that the hair would grow back worse/having stubble but I realized quickly that the hair that I wasn’t shaving was too visible (for my own comfort) to leave alone.  While it is a pain, shaving has had an unanticipated liberating feeling in the way that I relate to my body. It’s removed a lot of the gendered “norms” which I realized also were a major factor in making me feel too scared to start shaving. Now, it feels as normal as washing my face.

You are definitely loveable and deserving of love. I know it’s really hard to feel that way sometimes with the issues PCOS presents but there are lots of people out there that won’t care. And If someone does and tries to make you feel less than then move on. That would say more about them as a person than you.  I’ve dated plenty of guys who haven’t cared and my experience is that most are pretty understanding of the issues.   Also if it really bothers you I suggest investing in laser and electrolysis and making it a priority. The older I get the less I care but I still get self conscious. Investing in laser and electrolysis has made a huge difference to me and my confidence.    And also remember that everyone has hair/body hair and it’s way more normal than we think. Media portrays these unrealistic ideals of people being hair free. That’s simply not normal even for people without hormonal issues.,/r/PCOS/comments/f4dwe5/pcos_hirsutism/fhripfv/,comment,2020-02-15 21:28:50-07:00

"Ok I started writing a very long comment about how I was bullied and then my ex made things worse by criticizing everything on me (PCOS related or not) etc etc but all that doesn't really matter.    What matters is that you will be loved. There will be people who will love you for you, if you let your insecurities away.   I have a full beard around my neck, very hairy arms and legs and chest and torso, and my boyfriend is almost hairless by default, and the only thing he says about all this is that it's very unfair for both of us but oh well.

"Personally when I've experienced pain during sex its been up in my pelvis around where my ovaries are, and its been manageable with just preventing my husband from going too deep, and avoiding certain positions. Because of that I'm tempted to say it could be normal first time pain, but if you are taking your time and having foreplay to make sure you're both aroused it shouldn't be that painful, and there may be something else going on",/r/PCOS/comments/f4keo4/pain_during_sex/fhrbfjn/,comment,2020-02-15 20:00:49-07:00

"So two tips from a PCOS sufferer who was overweight and ruptured a disk in my back and had to have physical therapy for most of a year.    Lower back pain is usually ultimately caused by not getting enough movement in your day.  If you can get out most days and take a walk, even just 10 minutes, that will help in the long run.  If you sit for long periods, try to get up and move around for 5 minutes each hour.  For the short run, the stretch that almost always feels the best for me (and was recommended by my PT) is:  Lie on your right side, bend your knees and put your arms straight in front of you.  Keeping your knees still, turn your upper body so your back is flat on the ground with your right arm flat on the ground where it started and your left arm flat on the ground on the other side (like your upper body is a T.  Hold the stretch for 30 seconds then roll over and do the other side.  I do this stretch almost every day.",/r/PCOS/comments/f4in55/constant_low_back_pain_need_some_relief/fhr92xx/,comment,2020-02-15 19:32:56-07:00

"The half life of Saxenda is relatively short if I remember correctly I think it’s something like 13 hours. This is puzzling me because I was fine on the dose I was at and now I’m suddenly having issues. Another piece of the puzzle I put together this morning though is that while on the Saxenda and also after stopping, I loosely followed an intermittent fasting schedule. So I’ve been taking the Metformin at 7-8am and not eating until noon. The intense nausea almost always hits me right at 10am. I’m going to ensure I eat breakfast before Metformin tomorrow and see if it makes a difference. Fingers crossed.",/r/PCOS/comments/f4edeq/metformin_nausea/fhr86ms/,comment,2020-02-15 19:24:03-07:00

"Hi,  Before I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and went very low carb along with metformin, I would get the same things after eating. I think its the extreme plunge down after an insulin spike from food. I had those tired/dizzy spells and sometimes the shakes even after eating healthy foods like oatmeal, plain chicken breasts or protein, or sweet potatoes. After I started eating carbs below a net 50grams, the extreme dizzy spells and shakiness gradually went away.   Also food intolerance and allergies can also cause things like those. Some things to test to see if they cause you issues would be malitol (sweet potatoes), nightshades like persimmons/tomatoes/eggplant, nuts, dairy, and gluten/grains. Try eating them alone or with 'safe' foods and testing to see what you react to and what you can safely eat. Keep a diary.  If you've already cut out all processed sugar, try cutting out high sugar fruit and starches like rice, potatoes and replace them with veggies like broccoli, avocado, okra..etc.  Have you had a two hour glucose test to see what happens to your insulin/glucose after sugar? You might have insulin resistance, and that can give you hypoglycemic issues, and lead to type 2 diabetes if its not controlled. Please make an appointment with your doctor and do some tests.",/r/PCOS/comments/f4j0pi/extremely_tired_headache_and_dizzy_after_eating/fhr635t/,comment,2020-02-15 18:58:58-07:00

"This makes me so sad to read as I felt exactly this way for so many years, I hated my body so much and honestly believed that no one would ever love me. It's such a lonely feeling as everyone around me seemed to have perfectly smooth skin all the time and no one seemed to have these issues to my extent or understand it at all.  But you are definitely not unlovable just because you aren't completely hairless/have flawless skin or the ""perfect"" body. Literally no one in real life has a ""perfect"" body, we just get it shoved down our throats constantly in the media that we must look this certain way. It sucks so bad because PCOS seems to take away everything that is considered feminine/attractive from us.  However, there is hope and believe me you won't feel this way forever. I've been in a happy relationship for 5 years and my partner absolutely adores my body and is not bothered in the slightest that i'm literally hairier than him, and when we first started dating I had awful acne all over my back and face yet he still treated me like I was a goddess somehow. Over the years it's made me realise that looks are really not everything. Hating your body is so exhausting and makes you miss out on so much in life that it's just not worth it.

"Ah this was so painful to read because I feel the hurt coming through and it reminds me that I was feeling the exact same way a couple of years ago. I don't want to say I've made a miraculous recovery and it's all okay now because I still struggle, a lot. But remind yourself that there are people in you life who love you, even if it's not in a romantic/sexual way. Remind yourself of the things you do love about yourself - even if, in my case a while ago, it was only things like ""I can give other people really good life advice"", or ""I'm the person people call when they don't know the answer to something"". Start with those small things (I made a journal where I listed 5 things I was thankful for and five things to love about myself every day. In the beginning it was the same five things for about three months lol), before long you will hopefully start seeing more things about yourself and understanding the things that the people who love you appreciate about you. If you're feeling confident just ask them flat out what they admire about you and write that down until you start to see it yourself. And remember that nobody is unlovable, even if we don't love ourselves.   &amp;#x200B;  Plus, you have a whole community of lovely people here who will no doubt offer much more hair removal advice than I could, and who are around to support one another and be there when nobody else understands.

"I started using a menstrual cup in combination with either a reusable pad or Thinx underwear. It was expensive to buy all that at once (my old menstrual cup had to be replaced too), but it gave me a backup plan. Highly recommend Thinx. They’re comfy and work well, too bad they’re so pricey...  Now, I started to change my diet and was able to lose 20 pounds in about 6 months. After two months, my periods became much more regular and bearable. I haven’t lost anymore weight (still need to), but my periods are now monthly and 5 to 7 days long. Not sure if changing your diet is an option or even a problem for you. I tell you what though: when I start eating poorly, I remind myself how bad those weeks of heavy periods were and end up correcting my ways again.  Edit: on another note, have you tried a different cup? I had bought one to replace my old one (which fell into a Chinese squats potty). The new one had a trendy little spout to clean out blood with, but it was long and just rubbed me raw every time I used it.

"Hi. I think a whole foods approach might be best to start out with, and your idea of lowering carbs to by a smaller amount at first is great. The biggest thing is probably trying to cut out junk food/trigger foods because that's the hardest part of any healthy life long healthy eating plan.  Eat when you're hungry, not board/stressed/tired, and don't feel guilt about eating more calories as long as the food is good nutritious natural food.  I've noticed a lot of PCOS ladies suffer from unhealthy relationships with food, past trauma, and an inability to handle a lot of stress without major mental and physical repercussions. Going slow and being kind and patient to oneself is an essential skill. It might be better to just keep a diary on when you eat, and how you feel before and after rather then counting calories/carbs. A lot of time hunger can be from lack of sleep, stress, or not enough water. I don't say this to pressure you, but personally, I've transition from low carb to now doing IF and keto over the last 5 years simply due to it being the only way I can feel even keeled and have the occasion 'normal' day. I noticed an almost complete stop to binging, and the extremely hungry days driven by an inability to handle stress and spikes in insulin. As my insulin levels improved, i notice it helps a lot with the extreme depression slumps, irritability, and the mood swings. Telling myself that i won't eat stuff that makes me feel horrible for days afterwards in various manifestations of achy joints, headaches, tiredness, or hypoglycemic assumptions makes it easier to stay away from those foods designed to be addictive and play havoc with our physical and emotional well-being.",/r/PCOS/comments/f3tpln/low_carb_and_mental_health_feeling_conflicted/fhpkqvp/,comment,2020-02-15 11:31:56-07:00

"First time poster, but I've been lurking for a while! First of all, congratulations!! I have classic ""string of pearls"" PCOS and the homozygous C677T MTHFR genetic mutation. I currently have a healthy almost 9 month old daughter and didn't have the easiest time getting her here. Some women have absolutely no issues whatsoever with their PCOS as it relates to pregnancy, but here was my personal experience. I was immediately put on progesterone pills, and then suppositories, and then pretty quickly progesterone in oil through intramuscular injection twice a week as my progesterone levels never got high enough to maintain on their own. With the MTHFR (which is more common than people think!) I can't absorb folic acid because my body can't break it down, so I took a prenatal vitamin with methylfolate in it. [This one was great for me.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VFYYAC4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_51bsEbV5XJ3A2) I did clear it with my doctor as opposed to the more expensive prescription ones, and he said he actually liked this one and it was just as good. I also tried Lovenox injections for about a month due to the clotting issues with MTHFR, but I found out I was allergic to it and ended up taking 2 baby aspirin at night. I passed my glucose test, but did develop pregnancy related hypertension and was put on meds for that around 20 weeks. It has since gone back down and high blood pressure does run in my family. I ended up with twice weekly appointments for growth ultrasounds and NSTs around 32 weeks, because my doctor said I had ""pre- preeclampsia"" and they were getting a little concerned. My blood pressure ended up flying all over the place and I delivered at 37 weeks to the day with internal monitoring, but no other issues. Again, this is my personal experience but I would recommend asking about the best prenatal vitamins for you as well as making sure your progesterone levels look good if you are concerned. Also - PLEASE do not feel like you need to stick with your same provider if you feel like they aren't taking your concerns seriously. That is totally your right. Sorry this got so long, but hopefully it offers you a starting point and some hope!

"Hello and I am so sorry about how you feel. I can imagine how upsetting it is, when you long for something that others seem not to have any value for. You have every right to feel frustrated but also know that these emotions worsen pcos symptoms. It takes Doctors a long time to diagnose because the symptoms are complex and can be suggestive of so many other problems. They said I had pcos and it took 6years to have our baby naturally after all fertility treatments failed. I honestly spend a lot on ovulation kits and they were always off because of how pcos can affect the body and to be honest I stopped using them. You can try that to see if that works for you like a comment suggested. There is no fixed solution and different things work for different people and that itself can be frustrating. Maybe you can see about visiting a specialist as well. An OBGYN who specializes in endocrinology. I pray your #3 comes in due time. In the interim.. please try and relax a little, find some gratitude in where you are and be hopeful. Wishing you the very best.

"So sorry to hear about how you are feeling- I TTC for 6 years and i can imagine how you feel. To be honest, sometimes people do not realize how those around them are affected by what they say. They have no clue and do not mean to be insensitive. Just try and focus on yourself and what you are looking to achieve/your end goal- a healthy baby. Also keep in mind, life's journey will never be the same for everyone.

"Good evening, PCOS makes things tricky and I would say take it easy and give things a little time. A person with PCOS can have a perfectly normal pregnancy but also it depends on the individual's intensity of pcos. Some people have mild symptoms, some severe if that makes any sense. The doctors told me in 2012 that I had pcos, tried to conceive for 6 years- all fertility treatments failed and God blessed us with 2 babies - natural. Did not have any issues related to the PCOS diagnosis. If you are under the care of a doctor, I would recommend a visit for blood confirmation of pregnancy, checking blood sugar levels as necessary and whatever clinical interventions are necessary.

"Hii!! I was/still kind of am in the same boat as you and I would legit cry every day because of my PCOS related acne &amp; would even cancel plans because of it. It sucked. And I feel your pain.  So, the things that helped me control it (I still have acne, I’m trying out birth control for the first time so hopefully this helps eliminate ALL of it soon) , but:   Literally do not eat ANY kind of bread, rice, fried foods, cereal, anything carb. Stay. away. from. carbs. Carbs raise your insulin levels very quickly which triggers your body to produce more sebum, clogging your pores and subsequently making your acne worse.  When I ate very low carb I noticed a difference in my skin by at least 50%. Took about a week to start to notice a difference.   The same goes for sugar. Carbs &amp; sugar &amp; dairy &amp; alcohol (ugh) are going to give you pimples. Sucks but it’s true for people with PCOS like us:( eat mostly fruits and vegetables and whole grains, nuts, and salmon and you will see a dramatic difference in your skin!! And i mean a strict ass diet.  Also, going on a walk every day helps. Idk how or why but walking helps my pimples.   Another thing that helped me too is just not having a skin care routine or doing anything to my skin besides washing it because all the product I was putting on my face made it worse I think. Cause our problem is from the inside so putting shit on top of our skin just irritates it.   Oh and I almost forgot, Spironolactone helped me. Not 100%. I would say it helped like 70% for a few months but it’s coming back again for me sooo that sucks. Lol. But almost everyone whose gone on spiro has noticed a huge difference and I highly recommend it for you. It will fake at least 3 months but it will work and give you some relief.

"I think the easiest place to start with diet approaches that is safe for people with eating disorders is to just start with cutting down on sweet treats.  Don't 100% cut them if it makes you too anxious, just cut down to like, 1 or 2 per week.  Honestly sugar is the biggest offender in carb land anyway so cutting that out gets rid of the bulk of the problem.    Be kind to yourself.  If you fall off the wagon you've chosen, just set it aside and hop back on.  Don't beat yourself up about it. Just be deliberate about your choices rather than letting them happen to you.  If you have a history of an eating disorder, I would not count calories or carbs, just focus on making sure you get enough protein and fat at every meal so that you feel full and don't feel the need to stuff yourself with bread or pasta or rice.  There are some [very recent case studies](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-020-0278-7) showing that ketogenic diets can work well for those with eating disorders because it helps control the raging appetite that often happens in the starve and binge cycle.  If you do decide to eventually go lower carbohydrate, I would definitely recommend working with a therapist supportive of your dietary choices.

"Hey girl first I’d like to say take a breath you seem very overwhelmed. It’s going to be okay! Secondly I’d suggest you find a diet that works for you do some research online and there’s tons of information regarding different pcos friendly diets. Overall I would suggest lower carb/keto that has worked for me. Research shows carbs/sugar result in an insulin spike and it can negatively us who are insulin resistant. We need to balance our insulin levels by eating low carb/keto. I also recommend some sort of exercise regime it’s good for us mentally and physically! Lastly the BC issue is up to you, do you want to be on BC? If so find a gyno who will listen to your concerns, I call offices ahead of time and say “hi I’m looking for a gyno with experience in PCOS patients does anyone at your practice meet this requirement?” This way you don’t waste time meeting with different doctors who don’t have this experience.

"I wax the hair on my chin, upper lip, neck, and sideburns. It is a little painful but it is so worth it. I make sugar wax at home. I use 2 cups of sugar, 1/4 cup of water, and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Put that in a sauce pan and boil on low-medium heat for about 10 minutes until the wax is golden brown. Cut up an old t-shirt into strips. Once the wax has cooled down to a comfortable temperature you apply it to your skin in the opposite direction of the hair growth, then the strip of fabric over that rubbing it in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Then rip it off quickly in the same direction as the hair growth. It works wonders.

"It all depends. Within the last 3 months I've been on two different pills. The first pill made me nauseous and extremely horny the first couple of months and then this past month, I became VERY suicidal. The ONLY thing it helped me with was my heavy periods but I couldn't leave my house or go 5 minutes without bawling my eyes out. Then, I tried another pill and only lasted a week on it because I started gaining so much weight (even when I was eating the same amount) and was still emotional (but not as bad as the first pill). I know one of the side effects were insulin resistance. So, I came off of that pill and I decided I would rather be anemic and miserable for one week out of the month than gain weight and be suicidal.

"I have PCOS, and am currently 14 weeks pregnant after getting specialized help from a fertility clinic, and a doctor who was very familiar with PCOS and it's various symptoms. Because it is different for everyone, this might not be a solution for you, but it doesn't hurt to have more information:   I started with having a period induced, which to be honest, was probably one of the worst cycles I have ever had. During my cycle, on Days 3-7, I would take Letrozole, which doesn't appear to be as common as Clomid and some others. It is more typically used in breast cancer patients, but had the desired side effect of forcing ovulation (which is my issue -- I don't ovulate.)   Letrozole would block my estrogen production during those five days, after which my body would go into estrogen production overdrive to make up the gap, thus forcing follicle growth in my ovaries, in hopes one would become a viable egg.  Around Day 14, I would be sent for an ultrasound, to determine if I had any potential follicles/eggs coming, and then told to get at it with hubby every two days.   For us, it worked, once we got the dosage right and I was ovulating regularly. We conceived on the fourth successful ovulation.   Other points: Hubby was good on his end (we had him checked too), and the rest of my plumbing looked good, so ovulation was our biggest stumbling block. I definitely had some side effects of taking the Letrozole, or when I needed a period induced (if one didn't come during treatments), but this was mostly just a bit of grumpiness and a lot of headaches.  I'm also in Canada, so the appointments, meds, and ultrasounds were all covered by our healthcare system. I don't know how it works in other countries.  I hope this helps! We were extremely surprised to see a positive on the stick, as we were at it for a year before we could get help, and then about 9 more months before we got our successful cycle. I'm 35, so it was definitely an emotional road to get here, but we also didn't start trying until I was 32-33ish.

"Have you tried using ovulation kits to see if you are ovulating on time?

Our problem was that I did not ovulate on any kind of regular basis, if at all. While we were doing fertility treatments, there were still cycles where I wouldn't ovulate (even though we thought I was.) Because PCOS is so varied for everyone, this might be a possibility?

"I'm sorry you went through this. That must be so hard to deal with.  Unfortunately, there are some experiences people can't really get until they go through it themselves. The time I had my heart broken... it was so much harder and more painful than I could have imagined. I wanted to go back to friends who went through break ups and apologize for not supporting them enough.  Likewise for fertility things. I could never have guessed how hard this would be and how many triggers are out there until I started going through it. I truly don't mean to excuse your friends - they should know better, if not because they should be more empathetic but because you told them. But they might not realize the connection between what they think are casual remarks and how strongly this affects you.  I'm glad you're making a bit of space from that conversation. When you start feeling better, maybe go back in the chat and say something like: I know you can't know how hard this is for me and I really don't want to be a bummer all thr time, but I'm more sensitive about this than I'm letting on. Pregnant Friend, I am happy for you but I've got a bad case of the envies. I want to support you as much as I can here but it's hard for me to see conversations like the one above because frankly, I'd kill to have the kind of problems you have. You do have a right to complain because what you're going through isn't easy, but it would be better for me right now if pregnancy conversations could happen outside of this chat.  I mean, that's the diplomatic, super tactful option. You don't need to do that. You can be short with them if your relationships can take it. Sometimes people need to hear sharper words to change behaviours! But as hard as this is now, it's temporary. Eventually your friend won't be pregnant and eventually 🤞 you will be, and ideally these two pals will still be around because you didn't go full blownsies on them. People really don't know what to do others going through grief, which is basically what this is: you're grieving the fertility/pregnancy journey you wish you had, and you're preemptively grieving the child/family life you're not sure if you'll get. That's so much to hold inside.  It might be worth seeing someone for help, if you haven't yet. I'm working with my therapist using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques and its helping me a lot. I know that's not available to everyone but if you can go to even a session or two, you might be able to find ways to dull those triggers a bit.

"most of us, especially with PCOS, have messed up relationships with food. I had to restrict heavily throughout my 20's so as not to gain weight and I had no idea why it was so much harder for me than for everyone else. I was on birth control at the time and it really controlled my symptoms so I'd pretty much forgotten about PCOS or at least assumed it wasn't related.  overcoming that is a journey, because feeling like you need to restrict leads to a binge/purge cycle. or, if you're like me, you find yourself restricting nutritious food so you can fill up on crap. I'd limit my intake of meat and veggies but then have no off switch when it came to shit like bagels and candy. it is *hard* to overcome those habits especially when your metabolism is working against you at a cellular level. one step at a time.  you really can beat it, but you have to put your mind to it. day one is the hardest. day 2 isn't much better. but every day it gets a little easier. by day 5 or 6 I woke up feeling energized and felt my depression lifting, a strange feeling. when I would be tempted to eat something sugary or carby I'd remind myself that if I abstained I'd be proud of my progress when I woke up the next morning, but if I gave in I'd wake up feeling like shit physically and about myself. I'm a few months in now and it's really effortless. my PCOS is gone and that keeps me going! my symptoms were bloating, hypoglycemia, complete lack of cycles, and hair loss. the bloating and hypo episodes stopped after a few days, my period came back after a month, and my hair started regrowing at about the 1.5-2 month point.   it helps to find some low carb variations of foods you like... for me, rebel ice cream and mission low carb tortillas have been life savers. it also helps to have people around you who support you and gently hold you accountable. like my SO never told me not to eat something, but when I wanted a piece of candy he'd be like ""remember it'll make you feel really crappy"" and that was enough.",/r/PCOS/comments/f3tpln/low_carb_and_mental_health_feeling_conflicted/fhlfgy5/,comment,2020-02-14 10:09:28-07:00

"Hi! Maybe I can shed some insight as to why they are not checking for HPV. It is a nationwide recommendation by the USPTF to not screen for HPV before 30. Why? Because many  woman have many strains of HPV in their teens and 20s, however by the time they are 30, the body's immune system can usually get rid of the HPV without any intervention. If a woman is 30 and tests positive for HPV, that means that the HPV has had enough time to clear from the body, but has not which is a problem. That is when further testing needs to be done.  So let's say they did an HPV test on you, and you were positive (which you and every other 26 year old would be) you would have to wait 1 year to have another pap smear according to guidelines. If that one was positive again for HPV then you would have a colposcopy which is a painful procedure which has its risks. At your age, the risk/benefit does not make sense as it is possible your body with naturally get rid of the HPV.

They've tested me for hpv at every single pap I've ever had. I always ask to be tested for anything and everything in terms of stds.  As far as the birth control is concerned.....medical interventions for pcos are scant. Birth control is one of the few options available and can bring tons of relief. My 5 years on the mirena iud was the best of my reproductive life and if it wasn't for trying for a baby I would be back on it. It was the most effective form of treatment for me.  Other things help my symptoms but nothing got rid of them all except the mirena.

"OK I'm happy to assume you're not a troll. But advising people to get into (or stay in) a relationship to ""fix"" a medical condition is pretty terrible advice. Firstly, that's just not how it works, and secondly there's at least 2 things in your post that could easily be attributable to your reduced symptoms - less stress (from no longer being in an abusive relationship, and yes, now being in a positive relationship) which is obtainable outside of being in a relationship, and taking vitamin supplements. Additionally you could also be eating better &amp; exercising more without realising that that can help your symptoms.   As someone who has been in a relationship for over 5 years, this does not cure your PCOS lol.  ALSO. That link appears to be related to bitcoin crypto-mining.

Now your hormones are a bit confused - it was gearing up to have a period next week but now it's being told to hold off. Eventually you'll take the placebo pills and the lack of medicine pills will trigger your period. When I was on birth control (NuvaRing) I'd remove it on Sunday and get my period on Tuesday.  You probably won't have a period until you move onto the placebo pills, and even then you might not have one as your body sorts things out.

"IMO, trying to manage hormones without BC is the best way to go in the long run. Low GI eating and even going as far as reducing carbohydrates can help.   I also do seed cycling, which isn't supported on this sub but it has helped for me. Certain natural supplements can work as well, like ashwagandha, maca, etc. If you start looking for studies you can go down a rabbit hole.   Metformin seems to be successful for many on here. I personally haven't tried it.   For my marriage, counseling was really important. My moodiness, self esteem and body image were all bad. The moodiness led to me picking fights.

My NP told me my hair isn’t really extreme- that I don’t have chest hair or neck hair. I figure she would have a better idea of “normal” than me.   Hairy women aren’t depicted in our society. I think we are JUST starting to see some movements toward accepting body hair and giving up shaving. If I had to choose, I’d definitely like less hair or at least not as dark. However, as I’m aging I’m trying to do more work in accepting me as I am. I say all this because I think I’m our minds we feel a lot worse than we are.

I hope you see this OP. Hirsutism was at one point my worst symptom. It first showed up when I was 14 . Ive had people comment on it so I know it wasnt just normal peach fuzz and it only got worse until I turned 16. That's when I got diagnosed and sought treatment. After 2 years on Diane 35 I've seen a noticeable reduction to the point where I don't even have to remove facial hair anymore. The terminal hair on  my toes and feet also stopped growing and my arm hair has thinned.

"It's taken months of trial and error, tracking my food on cronometer, and making adjustments. I've been eating 100+g protein per day (3 meals of 30g). And keeping my net carbs around 30-35g/day. I have BMR damage and my doctor/dietician is helping me to sort that out. So I'm eating only 1200 calories per day.  I'm hungry most of the time and a lot of days I cave and end up eating 1600 calories because being hungry all the time sucks.  I do find that eating something low-carb and fatty when my hunger gets unbearable helps. Peanut butter, sunflower seeds, and tahini are the mildest on my stomach. Pecans, avocados, and olives are more low carb/low glycemic index options too. My main protein source is pea protein powder (i'm vegan) and i find that it's very milk on my system. I usually make a green smoothie with it.  OVerall, it's super hard and being hungry sucks. I have depressive days when I feel really low, but that's less frequent after four months. Good luck to you.  Oh, another trick I have is broth. I'll take a hot cup of water and add some bouillion (or you could just heat up broth) and drink that when hungry.

"I believe I've heard that once your body has made a hair follicle in that place, that hair follicle stays unless it gets damaged in some way and stops producing hair - like laser or electrolysis or waxing (ripping out hairs over and over can damage the follicle but it can lead to ingrown hairs or split hairs but I suppose over time the hair stops growing).  So what you *can* do is lose weight and control your diet so that your body stops making hair follicles in places you don't want because of your hormones. But for the ones already existing, you'll have to figure out a way to get rid of them.  I'm currently seeking electrolysis for my face, and have done laser on my bikini line, butt and underarms, but I'll probably need to go back for more.

"Most people eat around 300g of carbs per day. I personally do well around 100-150g per day. Any lower than that and I feel lethargic and am more likely to have cravings.   If I focus on eating healthy, complex carbs, I naturally will only eat around 100-150g carbs. I think sugar and bread were my downfalls! I still allo myself to have bread and sweets, but not nearly as often and in smaller amounts.   Here’s a typical day for me:   Breakfast: overnight oats with chia seeds, protein powder, almond milk, and berries. I stick to 1/3 to 1/2 cup of oats, the protein powder helps a lot with feeling satiated with fewer carbs.   Lunch: chicken salad with veggies to dip in it, like carrots, cucumbers, and bell pepper, maybe a few whole wheat crackers as well. Or I’ll have a salad with various veggie/fruit toppings, chicken or beans for protein, cheese, and a dressing. Sometimes I’ll have a few croutons, depending on the type of salad, I just make sure to not go overboard.   Dinner: a lot more variable, but I’ll mention some of my favorites some of my favorites. Sloppy Joes is  really good over half a baked potato with some sautéed veggies on the side. Bruschetta chicken - seriously delicious, check out recipes on Pinterest, good with a side of veggies. Marinated salmon with veggies. Both of these I would have with brown rice of quinoa if I have the carbs and calories for it, which I usually do.   I personally can’t stand cauliflower rice on its own. But mixing it in half and half with brown rice helps SO much. It still tastes mostly like brown rice but the carbs are basically cut in half, and I get in an extra serving of veggies. Cauliflower pizza crusts or pastas are also pretty good. They still have carbs, but less than the regular wheat versions. Same for pastas made from legumes like lentils or chickpeas, and the extra protein in these makes them more filling as well.",/r/PCOS/comments/f3ef4i/can_someone_help_me_with_the_low_carb_diet_thing/fhj2arf/,comment,2020-02-13 16:32:20-07:00

I typically do between 50-100g of carbs when doing low carb.  The closer to 50 the better for me but some days are higher than others.  It does take awhile for my stomach to get used to eating less food and less carbs so I'll get the hungry feelings about when you do.  I drink some water since I'm usually more thirsty than hungry at that point.  I also have some cheese or meat stick for a snack if I need one.

"First off, welcome!   I unfortunately don't have a lot of advice to offer, other than waiting to see what the rest of your bloodwork comes back with, but even then, my fertility doctor diagnosed me with PCOS based more on my ovaries, and less on my bloodwork. She sees a lot of PCOS, so I just rolled with her expertise.   A lot of us here struggle with our own bodies, and the acceptance of them, so don't feel bad about talking about anything with us -- many of us have similar troubles, and I don't think there's anything we haven't seen at this point.   For me, I have similar thick hairs on my lower abdomen. I tend to shave them every so often when they get to be extra annoying. I have some hairs on my breasts as well, but not thick enough to give me troubles with in-growns. I typically pluck the darker ones as they get long enough.  If you are comfortable with the idea, you may want to speak with an esthetician about any unwanted hairs. They have seen everything and more. It took me a while to get comfortable with mine, but she kept telling me I would be surprised at how many women come in to get waxed on a daily basis -- so many of us struggle with hair growth, but keep it to ourselves. I'm less ashamed now, and get my face waxed every 1-2 weeks as needed. It's been a big boost to my self-confidence.

"I'm in somewhat of a similar boat since I also had to move between countries and change doctors.  First off, it'd be ideal to find a doctor or clinic (real doctor, with a degree, not ""holistic healer"" or anything like that) who *specializes* in PCOS or at least in treating Insulin Resistance and preventing diabetes. I've bounced around a lot of doctors and the real work only began once I got to a PCOS clinic a couple month ago. Working with a doctor who doesn't know about the condition or doesn't take it seriously is going to be a headache. If you can't find one then you could try to ""guide"" whoever you're working with to prescribe you the right tests so *you* have the full picture and can either self-treat or push your doctor in the correct direction. For example, in Ukraine, where I'm from, I can just walk into a bloodworks lab and buy any tests I want - it's better to be directed by a doctor who knows what to look for because sometimes even the day of your menstrual phase matters, but worst case, at least you'll have some insight.  Important things to test for:  - hyperandrogeny - excess of male hormones. They are what  usually causes acne, balding, extra body hair, irregular menstruation, changes in far distribution pattern (belly fat accumulation), etc. If they're the cause of your acne, topical treatments might just not be enough. These tests would include free and general testosterone, Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), maybe androstenedione - disclaimer: I'm not a doctor, these are just the androgen tests which my doctors have ordered treating me. Note that a) general testosterone can be normal at one point but other androgens' could be spiking, for example, I had all the androgens' in order and only androstenedione hightened at one point, but at a later point it changed; b) your bloodworks shows levels of hormones in *blood* and it's an important diagnostic criteria - however, even if blood levels are normal, the levels in *in tissues* could be unhealthy and it can't be checked. For example, I started taking an acne medication which acts by blocking the effects of androgens in tissues and it helps - but my latest blood tests showed normal androgens which meant that the excess was only present in tissues (that's what the endocrinologist told me).  They might include more tests, these are what was relevant for me.  - hyper- or hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia - these are the two conditions which my Endo said need to be eliminated as possibilities before we can confirm PCOS as the culprit. According to her, they can have similar symptoms, so we needed to make sure it wasn't either of them before treating this as PCOS. The most common tests for thyroid issues which I know of are the check up of thyroid itself and the TSH levels, but this is something to talk to a doctor about. Prolactin was tested for to exclude the possibility of hyperprolactinemia.  - FSH, LH, and estradiol were also tested for, but I don't know how they fit in, because mine were normal.  - insulin issues. Now this is very important! You have to be pushy about researching this side thoroughly because doctors can easily dismiss it if doesn't look catastrophic - exactly what happened to me. My previous PCP did the standard A1C test: an average level of sugar, and it came back completely normal, so he's concluded that my insulin sensitivity is fine and I just ""need to eat less"". Here's the thing: if you're diabetic, it will likely reflect that no matter the lifestyle, but if you're just slightly resistant and eat well - it's useless. My PCOS endo in addition to the A1C (which is average blood sugar) ordered a test called OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test): your blood sugar is measured after fasting for 12 hours, then you're given 75g of sugar in a syrup, wait for 2 hours, and then you blood sugar is measured again. This test shows very explicitly how your body *handles* the sugar rather than how it has handled in the past three months (A1C). So, in my case, for example, I had again a healthy A1C test, but the OGTT showed I had impaired insulin sensitivity (my result was one point away from ""prediabetic""). My endocrinologist explained it this way: because I don't eat sugar (no lattes, sodas, rarely candy, etc.) and don't overeat carbs, my blood sugar simply didn't rise that much over the three months to expose the insulin resistance - but it was there all along. I'm 168 cm tall, weigh between 72-76 kg, despite eating a reasonably healthy diet, cooking at home and picking every product in the store to avoid extra sugar (which is hella difficult in the US). In the past, I've dieted and exercised, as much as living on 900 Cal/day and two-three hours at the gym every other day - and I haven't lost a gram - all thanks to, I know now, the insulin resistance. So, exercise and healthy lifestyle are important - but it's very possible that they simply won't be enough, so don't rush to blame and torture yourself - treat your IR. I had a period of remission, I guess, in the past, and weighed 55-60 kg with 0 effort made, so that's the difference insulin resistance made for me. Here's a quote from a research paper: ""Dr. Denis Magoffin (Los Angeles, California) [...] emphasized that the reproductive dysfunction is secondary to the endocrine abnormalities common to PCOS, including hyperinsulinemia and adipose tissue secretions"".  - these aren't strictly core tests for the PCOS, just something I happened to come across in research: Vitamin D levels and SIBO could be worth checking. I came across a couple articles suggesting a connection, and indeed I'm vitamin D-deficient (will be checking for SIBO soon). General advice: start educating yourself, and I mean push through the scientific papers available online, not self-help charlatan programs and ""feel-good"" blogs touring their own diets, supplements, etc. Granted, some supplements do actually help, but it's better to base your choices on actual research, especially if you end up having to self-treat. There's a lot of people in the web preying on the desperate PCOS sufferers and peddling their ""plans"", so be suspicious. I usually dig up medical articles here, but even there it's better to read suspiciously:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669857/ Naturally, I suggest reading the most up-to-date research (there's plenty even from 2019).  There are various theories about the causes of PCOS, research is ongoing. One theory is that insulin resistance causes your body to produce too much insulin in response to riding blood sugar levels, essentially steeping your ovaries in it - and they in turn produce too much androgens (which is their natural response to insulin stimulation, but boosted into the unhealthy range). I'm not a doctor, and there other theories out there, so take it with a grain of salt, but to me - it looks like IR is at the core of this condition. Once it gets out of control, it starts exacerbating itself: you get fatter thanks to IR, fat cells, especially visceral fat (inside the body, around organs, etc) , start affecting your insulin function, and hormonal balance further, and it just snowballs. In simple words, in my experience, the less fat I am, the less pronounced all the other symptoms become (although, there's something called ""lean PCOS"", but I take it you're not one of those cases).   My current treatment as prescribed in the PCOS center at BIDMC in Boston is:   - Metformin (insulin sensitizer, commonly prescribed for PCOS). Some people replace it with Berberine which an over-the-counter supplement which *could* have similar or better effects - I haven't made my mind about it yet, but there's some research which suggests it could be at least as effective). Read up about it, make up your mind - Berberine doesn't need a prescription. If you're prescribed metformin, insist on the Extended Release (ER), it's easier to tolerate, and take it with meals, it helps stomach the side effects.  - Spironolactone - normally, a blood pressure and liver medication, as well as potassium-sparing diuretic, it also blocks the effects of androgens in tissues. It usually helps with hormonal acne, hirsutism, and slows down hairloss due to male-type alopecia. It helped me very noticeably, and it's commonly prescribed for PCOS. If you take it, watch your potassium levels to avoid hyperkalemia or kidney stones. There's mixed research about over-the-counter alternatives to this treatment which could address hyperandrogeny. I don't know enough about anything that works, saw recommendation about spearmint, flaxseed, soy - if you can't get any anti-androgen treatment, those might be worth looking into if you can find compelling research.  - Vitamin D - I happened to be severely deficient, and it is involved in insulin function somehow, but you could be lacking other vitamins. Common for PCOS deficiencies seem to be B12, D, C, magnesium, folate, potassium, calcium, and not enough protein and fiber intake - this is something you could look into even without treating PCOS. Keep in mind, that excess of any of those could be problematic so it's best to only take vitamins and supplements for those if you're tested and found deficient.  - muscle-building exercise and high protein diet, although I will be seeing a nutritionist in April to talk in more detail about a diet. Low-carb and intermittent fasting are likely because both reduce the blood sugar spikes and give time for the ovaries to not be stimulated (ramesebolton wrote about the mechanism somewhere here on the subreddit), but for now my Endo simply suggested building up muscle because muscles use up the glucose and are thought to decrease blood sugar levels.   I will also bring up inositol next time I see my doc, because there seems to a lot of compelling research suggesting it helps, but I haven't tested it so far.

"I beg to differ. My daughter has a very damaged brain, I caught a very common virus called CMV in the first trimester and that has led to bi lateral ventrculomegaly, cysts x3, calcifications x3 and polymycrogyria then at birth she has sepsis which led to a stroke to her cerebellum.   I pumped breast milk for a year for her, as was recommended by her doctors and she is a perfectly healthy 2 year old. Was told she would never have a normal life (wall, talk, eat solid food) at 4 weeks old and now all of the professionals in her life ask us what we think we did differently for her to be doing so well. So breast milk to me is super important. My kids are also allergic to cow milk protein so the formula options are awful. Soy is not recommend because the oestrogen in it can effect grow later on in life. There is a hydrolyzed cow milk protein option but it awful.

"I find it’s easiest to not worry overly about calories at first (like for a few days to a week) and just focus on staying low carb, so eat when you feel hungry (maybe have a glass of water first just to make sure it’s not that) but eat low carb stuff.

I went back to the doctor and said I wasn’t going to take it anymore and he had the nerve to say “you should take it no matter how you feel”!   I’ve been doing my own investigating on PCOS diets and apparently it helps if we basically eat low glycemic index foods, as if we are diabetic or gluten intolerant, and no dairy. Low glycemic index foods because apparently people with PCOS have a harder time absorbing sugar into our cells so we need to eat foods that have little to no sugars (and carbs which turn straight to sugar). Elevated sugar levels in the blood stream in turn causes the body to release more testosterone, causing a woman’s body not to ovulate. No dairy (specifically A1 dairy) because people with PCOS often have a harder time digesting the protein and it becomes inflammatory. Why don’t our doctors tell us these things??

"PCOS is a really tough disorder for doctors to treat. most of them don't run tests sensitive enough to detect pre-prediabetic insulin resistance and even if they did there's not much they can do. in my experience PCOS is a disorder that you can manage yourself very successfully. here's what I recommend:  * 1500mg of berberine a day, taken with food. start at 500mg the first week, then 1000mg, then 1500mg. I recommend finding a brand that is manufactured in the US, canada, or europe as they tend to be held to higher purity standards than supplements that come out of asia, but if you can't it's not a huge deal.  * 4000mg of inositol per day. 2000mg in the morning and 2000mg before bed, doesnt have to be with food.  * a low carb diet. avoid sugar, refined carbs, and processed foods as much as you can. try and get lots of protein and moderate amounts of fat. meat, fish, leafy greens veggies, nuts, cheese, etc. in addition to lowering your insulin and alleviating PCOS symptoms this diet will also help shift your metabolism from sugar-burning mode to fat-burning mode.  * intermittent fasting as you are able. the diet will make this easier. start with an 8 or 10 hour window and reduce as you are able until you get to a place where you are comfortable. somewhere between 4 and 6 hours is ideal for PCOS because it gives your body 18-20 hours without an insulin spike and will put you solidly into fat burning mode. do make sure you are getting enough calories during the eating window to sustain you through the fasting window.  * drink lots of water!",/r/PCOS/comments/f3cf1d/pcos_and_nobody_is_doing_anything/fhi0a7d/,comment,2020-02-13 10:34:35-07:00

The good news is that you are very young and if you make some changes now at this point in your life, you can possibly prevent yourself from having cardiovascular difficulties or from getting type 2 diabetes, which women with PCOS are more prone to than those without.   Usually insulin resistance is treated with a drug called Metformin, and BC is a common treatment for PCOS in general. Ask your endocrinologist about trying Metformin - it has some unpleasant side effects (diarrhea, flatulence, nausea to name a few) but they are not supposed to be permanent.   My advice to you is to do research - check out some books, read articles online, etc. Make a list of questions you have and bring them with you to your doctor. Also, if it is a possibility, see a dietitian/nutritionist who understands what PCOS is because there are certain dietary guidelines those with PCOS should follow. It doesn’t sound like your endocrinologist knows what those guidelines are, which is very concerning. See a different endocrinologist if it is possible.

Skip down to section 3 where it outlines lifestyle factors.  You're right that staying on top of weight is a key element of managing PCOS going into trying to conceive. Going low carb seems to help a lot, though the above guidelines note that there doesn't seem to be one diet or another that's better for PCOS management, as far as research has uncovered.   The paper also recommends 150 minutes of exercise a week, with half of that being moderate and the other half being more intense, which you also have covered.   Aside from that, if you have the resources to see a fertility specialist, you should do so. Many GPs will tell you to spend a year trying and then come back if you have issues, but a year of trying + months of figuring out what's wrong + months or years correcting issues is a lot of wasted time. My fertility doctor loved that I started seeing her at 31, when I have time on my side. I also live in Ontario where most things are covered by universal healthcare so this process has been quick, easy and free with a few exceptions.  On top of that, you should start monitoring your temperature and cervical mucus if you aren't already. This is the cheapest and easiest way to tell if and when you're ovulating. OPKs or LH strips (I use the latter) are a great tool to use during the period when you think you could be ovulating to confirm.  It sounds like you're in a good starting position!

The truth is, [the vast majority of people ](https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/diets-do-not-work-the-thin-evidence-that-losing-weight-makes-you-healthier.amp) can't lose weight and keep it off.

Either the 'fat is bad' narrative is wrong or I'm unhealthy, and since the latter is demonstrably true, that means the former is the lie.  But even if I wasn't healthy (and that can change at any time!) I still deserve love and respect. Everyone does. Size variation doesn't make us less human.  Some accounts I like are: sofiehagendk and yrfatfriend for the social justice angle. Feeding.kids_intuitive.eating is focused on raising kids without hang ups but I find how she frames things helps me, i.e. chocolate isn't a bad food, it's a food that makes me feel a certain way. I don't follow any account that makes me feel bad about food or eating (I'm perfectly capable of doing that on my own!) I follow some weightlifting accounts because I lift but no weightloss accounts - if I see one more thin white woman in a sports bra, I'm going to go live in the mountains.",/r/PCOS/comments/f36g9q/how_do_you_learn_to_love_yourself_again/fhhmw5j/,comment,2020-02-13 08:27:57-07:00

"I am so sorry you are feeling this way. I wish I  could give you a big hug.I know you said you don't need someone to talk to, but if you are feeling suicidal you need someone to talk to. Are you in a crisis right now? If yes, you need to call a suicide hotline and/or go to the emergency room. Do you have a partner, close family member, friend, or doctor you can reach out to? Are you able to get any type of therapy?  I know you wish there was a cure, but right now there's not. So the best thing to do is to just manage the symptoms and try to get to whatever the root cause of your PCOS is.

There is ALOT of disagreement on her about false LH surges but from personal experience I get them all the time! I don’t trust them I do temp that works a little better for me. I’m not sure if your using a app to read your test you can use Premom or Femometer I usually use those two and upload photos and it tells me what it is. Like two weeks ago today I got a peak which registered 80s on premom and it said I ovulated but still no period so I’m thinking it was a false positive. It’s very annoying and discouraging.

"I guess the thing to remember is that shaving cuts the hair, so when it grows back it will have that blunt end, which can make it look thicker and thus darker, and can also make it feel a little rough (aka stubble) when it starts to grow back.  My situation is a bit different because I have a lot of hair grow on my neck. I used to pluck it for this reason but honestly it just took so long that now I just shave when I'm in the shower as part of my routine. The odd hairs I get on my chin or whatever on my actual face I just pluck.  I know some people go into laser hair treatments etc but I can't speak to that.

Pretty much the same for me and my son 3 years ago. He never got an official failure to thrive diagnosis because I started supplementing almost immediately but we did several extra weight checks in his pediatricians office.   I spent wayyyy to much money trying to increase my supply trying all of what you mentioned as well.   I did some of my own research into everything associated with PCOS and breastfeeding (which there isn’t much) and realized I might never get to fully breastfeed like I want. Some of what I found was about beast tissue development as well. I’ve always had proportionately smaller breasts.   We ultimately just fed him formula and I supplemented with the little bits of breast milk I was able to pump. He sometimes would breastfeed for comfort.   It’s very discouraging regardless but it made me feel a little (emphasis on little) better that it was likely out of my control.,/r/PCOS/comments/f2wbwt/pcos_and_breast_feeding_i_am_new_to_this_group_so/fhflb6i/,comment,2020-02-12 15:15:19-07:00

"DO NOT. I know too many people with and without PCOS whose symptoms have been made worse by birth control and / or have developed new ones. Birth control wont regulate your hormones. The fact that your doctor ""couldn't find anything else wrong"" and just slapped a PCOS diagnosis and a BC prescription on it like a big ol bandaid doesn't feel like good care to me. A lot of people dont know there are treatments that dont involve birth control, but there are. Ask questions about treating your specific symptoms without going on birth control and see where that goes. Also, finding a doctor who is a DO instead of an MD might be an option.",/r/PCOS/comments/f2yvq9/should_i_take_bc_what_are_yalls_experiences/fhfjy9q/,comment,2020-02-12 15:01:44-07:00

"I would like to throw in an opposite (but I totally understand, minority) view - I think that cutting gluten for me helped my inflammation levels, which seems to have helped my overall well-being and cycles. When I eat gluten and dairy, I have general signs of inflammation all over my body - yellow / red eyes, fatigue, inflammation markers in blood. All goes away when I cut both gluten and dairy, which is enough of an outcome for me to want to avoid it overall (with a small amount of cheating infrequently). I love carbs though, so I truly am swapping gluten carbs for non gluten carbs. I think overall though, I agree, for most people it’s just reducing carbs and helping insulin :)",/r/PCOS/comments/f2wd72/is_carbs_the_problem_or_is_gluten_the_problem/fhfj0se/,comment,2020-02-12 14:52:37-07:00
