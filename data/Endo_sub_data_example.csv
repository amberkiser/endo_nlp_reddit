0,Finally made an appointment I’ve been diagnosed with endometriosis. I of course had ablation surgery before I knew that it wouldn’t work. I’ve been putting off seeing an excision specialist for some time now.   Yesterday I took off my shirt and had blood coming from my belly button. That was my last straw. I can actually SEE my disease now. I’m done. I called Dr. Ann Peters in Maryland today.

3,"How do you combat feeling ""useless""? Hi Ladies - I've been dealing with a month long flare following bronchitis/made worse by anxiety, and I'm struggling to keep up with work and study. I've been unable to stay awake or out of bed for several days at a time. You know the drill!   Of course, having a chronic illness that does this to you can have you reminiscing over the life you used to live before your health crumbled. I can't eat/do/experience the things I used to or perform at the same level. How many of you have experienced feeling useless or like a waste of space? How have you dealt with this?

7,"Decided to get off the pill Around 6 months ago I was diagnosed with endometriosis based on my symptoms. I used to be bloated more than half the time each month and I had painful periods. The doctor told me to start taking contraception, as is the only way to slow down the disease and stop the symptoms.  I was reluctant at first, but I was also afraid of how the desease might progress otherwise, so I started taking the pill.   First 3 months were pretty unstable as I used to have nausea and I remember waking up just to throw up. Then I slowly realised that I was a mess emotionally. Really moody, sometimes depressed. Even though the nausea stopped, my emotional health deteriorated. I was happy that I didn't have to take painkillers during periods anymore, which were pretty light. Also bloating was becoming something of the past. But at the same time I felt like I was loosing all control over my life, my emotions, my whole being.   I started contemplating the idea of getting off the pill so I can gain back control over what and how I feel. Last period was the final trigger. The bloating was so bad, I felt like the before-the-pill days were back. So I said, if the pill is messing with my brain and it's not relieving my physical symptoms either, then I'm not starting a new pack.  So here I am, 10 days off the pill. I feel some discomfort on the left side of my pelvis, a bit bloated here and there. I'm looking now into changing my diet, reducing stress and trying to sleep better so I can fight this deasese at the root. I suspect the cause to be hormonal imbalance, and I hope I can find my equilibrium one day. Let me know if any of you managed to improve your life this way.  Good luck to anyone struggling with endo pain these days! Stay strong.",/r/Endo/comments/fkw6gd/decided_to_get_off_the_pill/,submission,2020-03-18 14:08:27-06:00

They said a laparoscopy would be good but won't be happening anytime soon due to coronavirus.

My original post (the link) is pretty wordy.  Basically, it's been suspected that I have endometriosis but haven't been tested. Different doctors have told me the pain is either endometriosis or GI pain, but nothing conclusive.  The pain is intense and frequent. It will throb and peak, then subside and come back. Based on the many ways I've heard contractions or labor pains described, I can only compare this crippling pain to that. I am not pregnant and finished my period roughly 5 days ago. The pain started 1 day ago. It seems to come within a week of my period ending now, every month. The pain used to be every 6 months and has become more frequent.   Pain originates from right side of pelvis near belly button, but not from belly button. It reaches my right side and the top of my ribs but not as much pain on my left side. It feels like extreme cramps, gas, hunger pangs, and muscle soreness after a hard workout. The pain comes in waves with brief moments without pain, but can last for hours at a time with no break and is so intense that I can't sleep. I use a heat pad, which helps minimally. No meds have seemed to work.  There is no pattern in what I eat causing pain other than if I eat, my stomach will shift. I feel whatever I drink go down my stomach. Urinating and defecating hurt my stomach and core. Feces is softer than normal during this pain, and I don't seem to be as gassy or pass gas as much.  Please help me out! This pain is so crippling, I can't move or breathe. Any position (sitting, laying, standing, crouching, curled up) hurts. I am at my wit's end.",/r/Endo/comments/fkt4qb/severe_pain_like_contractions_but_not_pregnant/,submission,2020-03-18 11:14:08-06:00
14,"Pain at night? Hi everyone,   I don't have a diagnosis for my pain and I'm wondering if my symptoms sound familiar to anyone here.   About 1.5 years ago I started waking up during the night from lower abdominal and back pain. It was limited to night time and would keep me up for maybe 15 minutes on average before it was mild enough for me to go back to sleep. I tracked what food I was eating and found no patterns. I started recording the instances on my calendar to see if there was any pattern and got nothing. I could go two months with no pain, have pain a couple times per week for a whole month, or for a week straight. Just no pattern at all.  There were two instances where the pain was severe enough that I became nauseous, seeing spots, was sure I would throw up (thankfully that hasn't actually happened yet), and was sweating a lot. So much that when I went back to bed, my boyfriend would put his arm around me half asleep and then wake up and ask why I was so wet. That's when I decided to make a gyno appointment.   The gynecologist said what I was describing sounded like uterine pain and during the pelvic exam, she was able to put pressure somewhere that caused a very mild but similar pain, confirming her suspicion that it is uterine pain. Her conclusion: menstrual cramps and take some advil when it happens. This is hard for me to believe though because I had pretty rough periods from the start and my doctor had me start taking the pill continuously in high school (over a decade ago). The cramps stopped and I've been on the same brand for several years. So it doesn't make sense to me that it would just start again out of nowhere. Add on that I could not find any sort of connection to time of month or where I am in my 3 week pill cycle...I just don't buy it. She also had no idea why it would only be at night.   Since then it has continued. There's been another two instances where it was sweaty nausea level pain. The biggest development is it's no longer confined to only happening in the middle of the night. Now I sometimes wake up with it in the morning, and there have been times where it's just come from nowhere in the middle of the day. When it's happened during the day, it's lasted several hours at times. I don't know if this is a change or if it's always lasted this long and I was able to sleep through all but the peak of it.   Does any of this sound like your experience with endometriosis? I haven't had a strong suspicion that that's what I might have because there's other endo symptoms (like pain with sex) that I'm not experiencing... but I'm at a loss so thought it was worth learning more about.",/r/Endo/comments/fkrf7z/pain_at_night/,submission,2020-03-18 09:34:46-06:00

He said that my symptoms are unusual and I don't understand why, but I couldn't ask him. I wanted your opinion as endo warriors and experts.  **I have:**   Daily pain (moderate to high) in the uterus, lower back pain, left ovary, head, knees and breasts. It used to be only during my periods but now is all the time.  Intense pain during penetration, cramps after orgasm and low pain while aroused. I don't have sex now for obvious reasons.  Dizziness, nausea, 'motion sickness' (similar to motion sickness but experienced while sitting in the sofa/chair). Problems while pooing (as if the poo isn't aiming correctly to the anus) and pain when 'I need to go'. I used to have diarrhoea while in my period.  Extreme fatigue, to the point that cleaning the living room+kitchen last week made me be the next 8 hours shaking in the sofa from the weakness and pain. I suspect that I might have Cfs.  Extremely intense periods (when I had them normally). The last years I had two weeks of spotting + one week of real period. But this is probably due to adenomyosis not endo.  **I dont have:** (He asked me)  Leg pain or pain during urination.  **Background:** 30yo woman with endometriosis (stage 2, he said 'deep endometriosis but I dont know if they are the same), adenomyosis and depression.

21,"Collapse So I was in hospital on Sunday getting my endo flare under control right. Was released once everything was sorted and came home to bed. The next day I am feeling 1000x times better. Got up, worked out, did some cleaning, did my washing, over all a good day day. Yesterday I woke up, still feeling great so I did some more cleaning, got my new bed frame and put it together and then went out to the garage to sort some stuff. As I was walking out of the garage everything from the waste down stopped working and I collapsed. Ended up spraining my left ankle again (did it a month ago as well, had an endo flare that I pushed myself through a little too much and fell down some stairs), tendons or ligaments in the right foot are tender. Left knee is sore. Grazed skin on both legs. Hips are hurt as well as wrist from falling/landing on them. Have been put on crutches to help with walking since it didn’t heal properly the first time and wrist a little sore from holding those. And then last night at about 4am I am woken up crying and pretty much screaming (I remember that I made some weird sounded noises but not sure if it was screaming or just loud) (also I was home alone) because my body was going through contractions. This happened for about 2 hours before it subsided enough for me to be able to go to the bathroom. Decided to take a clean pair of underwear and a pad just in case and it was a good thing I did cause there was so much blood on my inner thighs, thick clotted blood on my underwear and I was still pouring out blood while on the toilet. Let’s just say R.I.P to that nice beautiful pair of underwear I was wearing, they were my favourite and now they’re destroyed. I’m not supposed to have my period and there were no signs that my body was going to start this. Today I just have a splitting headache from the loss of blood and very little movement I’m able to do to keep hydrated. But does anyone else get this? Just random episodes with no warning?

However, I am sick of taking opioids, I took Orilissa for one day and then the research I uncovered terrified me into never taking it again, and my gyno has said a hysterectomy is not something he feels comfortable doing until I have exhausted all options (which I agree with), so birth control is where I am at.

33,"Advice Needed: Having an increase in symptoms and doctor can’t see me due to coronavirus Background: I was formally diagnosed with Endo in October following a laparoscopy, they also lasered off a lot of endo tissue while they had me opened up. This was after 5 years of symptoms and fighting to be taken seriously. Some of the worst symptoms (which are tmi but relevant) were severe rectal bleeding and (sword up the arse like-) pain, unbelievable cramps and prolonged bleeding which could last several weeks and at times lasted over a month. I also had a cauda equinas (3 discs collapsed inward onto my spinal cord) compression 6 years ago which required surgery and left me with permanent nerve damage and I’m technically disabled now even though I’m still not comfortable stating that, during this time my periods stopped entirely on their own for over a year. I currently have a cold and as I’m also a severe asthmatic I am self-isolating.  I have not had a period since my surgery in October, my gynae advised me to wait until around May to have a period and advised me to come back if any symptoms returned.

My GP is not seeing anyone amid the pandemic, I also can’t see my gynae and I’m at a loss as to what to do.

When I went in to the office to have it done, the doctor said he would have it shift off to the office for convenience. Called them yesterday (the day of my appointment), and they hadn’t received it either. And now my pain is coming back. It’s okay I guess. Most of the time it’s tolerable. I’m going to call them this morning and see if I should be out back on birth control since we don’t know when I’ll get the injection.

38,"does this sounds like endo? This is my first time posting here and i’m on mobile so bear with me for the format. I’m not officially diagnosed yet but I just want to get some insights from people so :-)  To begin, my symptoms started sometime last year when I had really painful bowel movements during my period, to the point that I almost fainted in the toilet.   I did went to see a doctor for this but they just gave me constipation meds and to just take normal painkillers. Also, my painkillers does not do much to the pain.   Apart from the painful BM, I do get these butt cramps? from time to time during my period, like they are sudden and have caused myself to be bedridden for a few hours on several occasions.  My latest update to my symptom list is having cramps when I’m not on my period, like I am having this dull aching feeling on my lower abdomen and I’m only halfway in my cycle and it has been happening for 4 days straight already.  I’m already making plans to see a OBGYN in May or as soon as possible and I just really am so tired of this already.

41,"Stopping smoking and Endo Hi,  I never had exploratory surgery so my diagnosis is not exactly confirmed. However, the pain related to my period and ovulation disappeared slowly after starting hormonal birth control (Mirena) which was suggested by a doctor as treatment. Unfortunately, after approximately a year the pain started to come back slowly in a regular fashion. I don't have any periods anymore so it's hard to tell but I write a health diary and for about 4 days a month I'm in pain. After being on lots of pain killers before I got the Mirena I try to avoid taking them as much as possible now and the pain is still bearable...  13 days ago, I stopped smoking and ever since I stopped I'm in constant pain. Constipation and pain ""on"" or close to the intestines are a major factor in my ""normal"" Endo pain and I'm experiencing a lot of this. I know that the constipation increased because I stopped smoking but this is slowly getting better and the pain moving towarss the uterus without any decrease in the pain.  Did one of you stop smoking and could share their experience? I'm starting to get a bit worried actually. I've been moving countries a lot and don't have a trusted gynecologist at the moment.

42,"Possible Endo diagnosis and kinda freaking out. Hi everyone. On mobile so apologies in advance for the formatting. Yesterday I went and had my Mirena reinserted after having to have an emergency procedure to have it removed a few weeks ago (got unlucky, it moved side ways and wedged hard after 6 months) and they did exploratory lap because I have still had a bit of lower right pain on and off, not to mention still bleeding through the Mirena (no where near as bad as before the Mirena though). Thought maybe a cyst because I’d had one before and since I was going under anaesthetic why not check it out.   Anyway, the Gyno was really concerned and cagey when I came out and in recovery and said my ovaries were really angry looking and they have sent biopsy away to confirm potential Endo and maybe something else... but I kinda tuned out because I didn’t think I even had - quarter of the symptoms of Endo. I have NEVER had painful periods. Like ever. Maybe the odd cramp that would maybe edge 4/10 but pop a Panadol and go on my way. Sure I’d bleed for 40 ish days on and 10 days off and repeat but I’ve recently been diagnosed with a Prolactinoma (brain tumour in the main hormone gland) so I thought that came down to that.  I’ve been experiencing painful sex - to the point I kinda stopped wanting to have it. The nurse did let me see the pictures when I got back to the ward and the do look similar but with a lot larger black lumps than my friend who has really bad Endo but I’m trying not to jump to conclusions but I’m kinda really freaking out because I have been told nothing.

52,"Could Weight Loss be Making Endo Pain Unbearable? As background, I was diagnosed with endo around age 18. I am 27 now and haven't had any surgery since the laproscopy that gave me a diagnosis. Back then my periods were debilitating, but over time got better.  My period usually lasts 4 days, the second day being the worst always, but they're not debilitating these days.  I have been in the process of losing weight for a few months now. I'm not any any type of strict diet, just limiting my calories/carbs and being more mindful of foods I'm eating. Over the past year I attempted to diet and would only do so for a couple months before falling and out of it. During this time I noticed my periods tended to be worse as well, leading me to think weightloss may be the common theme.  The past 3 months my periods have been excruciating, worse than I remember them being in my late teens. I'll speak about my most recent experience with this, noting the previous month went about the same.   I started early Thursday night, woke up Friday early morning in extreme pain. I took OTC ibuprofen but it did nothing and I literally could not move from a folded over position, similar to child's pose in yoga, without screaming. This went on for hours until I finally passed back out for a couple hours. When I woke up I still could feel the pain but I was at least able to move around and get to work at some point. Throughout the day I felt twinges here and there but nothing compared to the pain earlier in the day.   My question to all of you is could this be related to weight loss?   I'm not finding many articles on this issue, just how weight loss should make endo better, not worsen like this. Looking forward to at least hearing I'm not the only one this has happened to because right now I feel torn between trying to reach a healthy weight and giving up for the sake of not being in pain.

I had been very sick and throwing up over the last 48 hours and half of today was just dry heaving. I ended up having a shower to try and relieve some of the pain and ended up dry heaving more to the point my throat was burning and my head was throbbing. I ended up calling my mum to ask for help getting to the hospital and once there I was seen and put into a ward within the first 15 minutes of arriving (this is absolutely wonderful considering I’ve spent 6 hours in the waiting room alone). They took my bloods, urine test, etc. the normal stuff. And eventually put me on an IV drip cause I was too dehydrated. Today’s visit is so different from any others because the doctor who saw me (his name tag said his name was Ian) talked to me like I was an actual patient, like I was a sane human being who was actually in pain and unwell and believed me. He talked to me about his knowledge of endometriosis, my history with it and gave me advice on the best ways to be taking my medications. He also said it won’t necessarily be a miracle worker doing it this way or the way I was doing it before but it is worth a try. He knows it a chronic illness, he knows it’s incurable and he wasn’t trying to tell me that things will get better if I do a, b and c. Most doctors talk to me like I’m crazy and it’s all in my head that I leave the hospital in the same amount of pain if not more and extremely frustrated and angry because of the lack of knowledge or understanding or acceptance that DOCTORS have on this. But instead of being talked DOWN to he talked to me. He asked what I was feeling and what I wanted out of this. Apart from my GP he has been the best doctor I have seen. My pain went from a 12 out of 10 to an 8 out of 10 (which I know is still pretty high on the scale but on a day to day that is normal or average for me), it when down 4 units on the scales cause he took me seriously and listened to me and actually helped me. Instead of giving me pain killers I’ve already taken that weren’t working, hence going into hospital for additional help, he gave me oxycodone which is a strong pain killer I’ve never had before and it brought my pain down.

70,"I haven’t been diagnosed but I think I’m in the right place Just a bit of history.  At 14 I was diagnosed with PCOS. I was 135 lbs. By 18 I was 155 and told I was overweight and I hadn’t been having my period for over a year. By 19 I was diagnosed with infertility, told I was obese and I hadn’t even hit 180 yet. From 19 to now 25 I’ve started having irregular periods. At 22 I started getting my period but it would last for 3 months and be super heavy. At 23 I went is for my menorrhagia and pelvic pain and had a doctor tell me it was be I was obese and tried to put me on the Nuvaring and refused to even do a pelvic exam when that’s what I came in for to begin with. I tied the nuvaring after my period ended and it caused so much pain and the bleeding was way worse. I can’t even describe it. My father had to drive me to the hospital it was so bad.  The thing is I’ve gone to the doctor for years and all they’ve done is chalk it up to PCOS. I’ve been regularly having insomnia since a teen. Yet always tired and fatigued. As well as migraines once a week since I was a 14. My cramps use to be so painful I couldn’t move but now I’m so use to them that small cramps feel like nothing. I’ve never been able to enjoy sex because it causes me pain to even have something in there. And now here I am at 25, and apparently obese at 235 lbs, no matter how much I try to diet and limit how much I eat.

Back in October, I started having pain with deep penetration during sex, as well as a dull achiness in my pelvis right around ovulation. I set up an appointment with my gynecologist who suspected two small (3-4 cm) functional cysts on my left ovary. An ultrasound showed 1 large 9x6x7cm cyst, as well as a smaller 2 cm cyst. My gynecologist still suspected functional cysts and recommended a wait-and-see approach for 6 weeks. A follow-up ultrasound showed no change in the cysts. This is when the words “endometriosis” and “endometrioma” began being used. Surgery was scheduled for the end of February.   Through all of this, my only pain was with deep penetration, and the dull achiness right around ovulation. I had no change in my periods (which are not heavy, last 3-4 days, are consistent, and are not super crampy or painful).   Surgery time arrived, and it was 2 endometriomas on my left ovary. Apparently the larger was adhered to my uterus and pushing down on my cervix. She also ablated some small areas of endometriosis on my bladder and uterus.   Recovery has been amazing. I have 3 small lap sites, pain was well controlled with Ibuprofen, and I actually returned to work 3 days post-op (I’m an RN).

Here’s my 1 in a million story:  Since I was about 14 years old I have been experiencing hormonal-related migraines (uncomplicated type). I went onto the contraceptive pill at the time which somewhat managed my migraines. In most other ways, I was seriously fortunate to have relatively light periods of about 3-5 days. I rarely experienced cramps, maybe the mild ‘twinge’ every now and then. After my 18th birthday (the usual age in Aus for first Pap smear/test), I went off to have my first Pap test. The brush against my cervix was excruciating! My GP acted promptly and sent me off the gynaecologist. Within a month I had a laparoscopy, for which I was diagnosed with stage 3-4 endo and also had a mirena inserted at the time. I am also one of the very small percentage of women who don’t have a period with a mirena, and it’s been 4.5 years! Unsurprisingly, my migraines also stopped after this.   The reason why I’m telling my story is not to brag or gloat. I am actually extremely grateful and fortunate in my position. I wish majority of other women experienced endo in the same way I do (though I don’t wish it on anyone at all).   I want to encourage you not to ignore your symptoms, because it is a TOTAL MYTH that you must be completely disabled by your symptoms! Yes, some of us experience very few symptoms with very widespread endo. Others experience very serious pain with mild endo.

Thankfully she said she was able to remove it all and aggressively treat it by ablation. I was diagnosed at stage 2-3, more on the 3 side. I was so hopeful that my pain would reside but it didn’t.
